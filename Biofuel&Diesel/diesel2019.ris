AB  - Deforestation and uncontrolled emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) through abundant use of fossil fuels result global warming. This serious threat to the atmosphere has deeply motivated the researchers to develop new strategies for chemical fixation of CO2 and biofuel synthesis. Here we report the sulfonated porous polytriphenylamine (SPPTPA-1, BET surface area of 664 m2 g−1, pore volume 0.386 cc g−1) as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates via CO2 fixation into epoxides. SPPTPA-1 catalyst contains pores with dimension of 1.8-2.0 nm, which produced a H1 type hysteresis loop in N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm. The porous catalyst is thermally stable upto 196 °C. The synthesized SPPTPA-1 catalyst contains large amount of surface acidic sites. Further, it catalyzes the esterification reaction of levulinic acid, long chain fatty acids and dicarboxylic acids due to presence of its acidic sites. This solid acid catalyst SPPTPA-1 showed excellent recycling efficiency upto 5 times in all these demanding reactions. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass offers a renewable carbon source which can be anaerobically digested to produce short-chain carboxylic acids. Here, we assess fuel properties of oxygenates accessible from catalytic upgrading of these acids a priori for their potential to serve as diesel bioblendstocks. Ethers derived from C2 and C4 carboxylic acids are identified as advantaged fuel candidates with significantly improved ignition quality (&gt;56% cetane number increase) and reduced sooting (&gt;86% yield sooting index reduction) when compared to commercial petrodiesel. The prescreening process informed conversion pathway selection toward a C11 branched ether, 4-butoxyheptane, which showed promise for fuel performance and health- and safety-related attributes. A continuous, solvent-free production process was then developed using metal oxide acidic catalysts to provide improved thermal stability, water tolerance, and yields. Liter-scale production of 4- butoxyheptane enabled fuel property testing to confirm predicted fuel properties, while incorporation into petrodiesel at 20 vol % demonstrated 10% improvement in ignition quality and 20% reduction in intrinsic sooting tendency. Storage stability of the pure bioblendstock and 20 vol % blend was confirmed with a common fuel antioxidant, as was compatibility with elastomeric components within existing engine and fueling infrastructure. Technoeconomic analysis of the conversion process identified major cost drivers to guide further research and development. Life-cycle analysis determined the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 to 271% relative to petrodiesel, depending on treatment of coproducts. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Considering that the world transport sector is the second largest contributor of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions due to energy use and the least decarbonized sector, it is highly recommended that all countries implement ambitious public policies to decarbonize this sector. In Mexico the transport sector generates the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions, in 2014 it contributed with 31.3% of net emissions. Two original scenarios for the Mexican transport sector, a no-policy baseline scenario (BLS) and a low carbon scenario (LCS) were constructed. In the LCS were applied 21 GHG mitigation measures, which far exceeds the proposals for reducing transport sector GHG emissions that Mexico submitted in its National Determined Contributions (NDC). As a result, the proposed LCS describes a sector transformation path characterized by structural changes in freight and passenger mobility, new motor technologies for mobility, introduction of biofuels, price signals, transportation practices and regulations, as well as urban planning strategies, which altogether achieve an accumulated reduction of 3166 MtCO2e in a 25 year period, producing a global net benefit of 240,772 MUSD and a GHG emissions' reduction of 56% in 2035 in relation to the BLS. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - This research proposes four scenarios for a multi-generation system to produce power, pasteurized milk, biofuel and fresh water for the northern areas of Iran. In all scenarios, power, pasteurized milk and biofuel are produced by a similar arrangement of a supercritical CO2 (S–CO2) Brayton cycle, a biomass gasifier and a milk pasteurization unit while the portable water is produced by a brine recirculation multi-stage flash (BR-MSF) in scenario 1, by forward, backward and parallel feed schemes of multi-effect distillation (BF, FF and PF-MED) in scenarios 2, 3 and 4, respectively. A comparative study is conducted for the exergy, exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental performances of all scenarios with various stages and effects using Engineering Equation Software (EES). The optimum performances of all scenarios are found by applying the fast and elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and using linear programming technique for multi-dimensional analysis of preference (LINMAP), technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and Shannon entropy decision makers. According to the results, the maximum distillate water with capacity of 400.6 m3/day is obtained for scenario 1 through Shannon entropy method. Moreover, scenario 4 gives the maximum exergy efficiency with a value of 44.16% using LINMAP method and scenario 2 with the lowest total cost and environmental impact (EI) rates of 77.15 $/h and 33.35 mPts/s, respectively obtained from TOPSIS method is the best layout from the economic and EI aspects. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - High water content remains a critical issue limiting the use of wood-derived fast pyrolysis oil (FPO), also called bio-oil or pyrolysis liquid biofuel, in mid-size diesel engines for power generation. In this research, FPO water content was reduced by 60% through distillation (DFPO) and by more than 85% by phase separation (PSFPO). Water removal significantly reduced its corrosivity, improved the fuel heating value, and resulted in greater storage stability. Diesel engine injector components immersed in FPO lost from 2.5 to 6% of mass in 84 h. From the different metals tested, tool steel corroded 300 times faster than the allowable limit, whereas stainless steel displayed no corrosion. These rates were reduced by a factor of 3 when water was removed by either distillation or phase separation. Although phase-separated FPO contains 50% less water than distilled FPO, it displayed similar corrosivity. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of the corroded samples confirmed the chemical nature of corrosion, whereas the formation of a Cr2O3 layer on the stainless steel samples was found to be the main factor inhibiting corrosion. Conversely, water removal exacerbated the problem of high FPO viscosity by raising it 28 times to that of diesel fuel for DFPO, whereas for PSFPO, in addition to increasing viscosity, it also displayed shear thinning. This combined with fuel preheating limitations restricted the direct application of dewatered FPO in a diesel engine. Therefore, to be used in a diesel engine with minimal changes in its pumping system, dewatered FPO was emulsified with diesel and the maximum possible emulsion viscosity was set to not exceed 3 times that of a diesel fuel. This emulsification was carried out with aid of a surfactant, and from six different surfactants tested, only Atlox 4916 and Hypermer 1599 produced stable emulsions for FPO and DFPO, respectively. Moreover, water removal in large quantities was found to have a detrimental effect on the emulsification potential of FPO and all of the emulsions produced from PSFPO stratified by 20% only in a day and the resulting two-phase liquid was found difficult to be used without extensive mixing. Furthermore, thermogravimetric analysis of PSFPO indicated high leftover carbon residue of around 30%, indicating a very high tendency for coking. Consequently, only moderate quantities of water removal from FPO (&amp;tild;60%) through distillation were found to be beneficial for broadening the scope of FPO application to electricity production utilizing diesel generators.

AB  - The enthusiasm for biofuels as feasible alternatives for use in diesel engines has significantly expanded on account of their spotless consuming nature in addition to fossil fuel independence. The present study utilizes two oxygenates, dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and n-butanol (n-B), derived from non-food-based lignocellulosic biomass in a blended form with transesterified oil extracted from waste sapota seeds to power a modern one-cylinder common rail direct injection (CRDi) diesel engine for any improvement in combustion, performance, and emission characteristics. Three test fuels, viz., B40%, B40% + DMC10%, and B40% + n-B10%, were prepared by splash blending, and the results were correlated with baseline diesel fuel. The experimental results indicate that accrual of oxygenates to sapota oil methyl ester has improved the combustion characteristics in comparison to diesel and B40% + n-B10%: the peak heat release rate (HRR) for B40% + DMC10% was 4.89 and 5.14% higher, respectively. The brake thermal efficiency (BTE) of an engine fueled with a B40% + DMC10% blend was better than that fueled with B40% + n-B10% but lower than that fueled with baseline diesel. The oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emission were higher side when the engine was fueled with both oxygenated blends compared to diesel: B40% + DMC10% exhibits 6 and 2% higher values than diesel and B40% + n-B10%, respectively, at peak load conditions. Smoke opacity experienced a sharp reduction when fueled with a B40% + n-B10% blend; there was about 11.76, 19.60, and 23.52% reduction when fueled with diesel, B40%, and B40% + DMC%, respectively. Carbon monoxide for B40% + DMC10% was the lowest compared to diesel, B40%, and B40% + n-B10%, and there were about 21.59, 86.85, and 34.74% reduction in emissions, respectively. Hydrocarbon emission for B40% + DMC10% was the lowest compared to diesel, B40%, and B40% + n-B10%, and there were about 8.62, 27.58, and 17.24% reduction in emissions. Reformulation of diesel with DMC, n-butanol, and sapota oil methyl ester renders a chance to decrease emissions and use renewable fuel in diesel engines. Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Efficient conversion of renewable biomass platform chemicals into high-quality fuels remains challenging. A one-pot catalytic approach has been developed to synthesize various structurally defined biofuels by using Hf(OTf)4 and Pd/C for selective tandem catalysis and 2-methylfuran (2-MF) as a renewable feedstock. 2-MF first undergoes Lewis acid-catalyzed hydroxyalkylation/alkylation (HAA) condensation with carbonyl compounds to afford intermediates containing the targeted carbon skeletons of hydrocarbon or ether products, and these intermediates then undergo hydrogenation or hydrodeoxygenation to afford the target products, catalyzed by metal triflate+Pd/C in the same pot. The present process can produce structurally defined alkanes and cyclic ethers under mild conditions. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - In this study we undertook quantitative source apportionment for 32 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measured at a suburban site in the densely populated northwest Indo-Gangetic Plain using the US EPA PMF 5.0 model. Six sources were resolved by the PMF model. In descending order of their contribution to the total VOC burden these are "biofuel use and waste disposal" (23.2 %), "wheat-residue burning"(22.4 %), "cars" (16.2 %), "mixed daytime sources"(15.7 %) "industrial emissions and solvent use"(11.8 %), and "two-wheelers" (8.6 %). Wheat-residue burning is the largest contributor to the total ozone formation potential (32.4 %). For the emerging contaminant isocyanic acid, photochemical formation from precursors (37 %) and wheat-residue burning (25 %) were the largest contributors to human exposure. Wheat-residue burning was also the single largest source of the photochemical precursors of isocyanic acid, namely, formamide, acetamide and propanamide, indicating that this source must be most urgently targeted to reduce human concentration exposure to isocyanic acid in the month of May. Our results highlight that for accurate air quality forecasting and modeling it is essential that emissions are attributed only to the months in which the activity actually occurs. This is important for emissions from crop residue burning, which occur in May and from mid-October to the end of November. The SOA formation potential is dominated by cars (36.9 %) and two-wheelers (21.1 %), which also jointly account for 47% of the human class I carcinogen benzene in the PMF model. This stands in stark contrast to various emission inventories which estimate only a minor contribution of the transport sector to the benzene exposure ( ∼ 10 %) and consider residential biofuel use, agricultural residue burning and industry to be more important benzene sources. Overall it appears that none of the emission inventories represent the regional emissions in an ideal manner. Our PMF solution suggests that transport sector emissions may be underestimated by GAINSv5.0 and EDGARv4.3.2 and overestimated by REASv2.1, while the combined effect of residential biofuel use and waste disposal emissions as well as the VOC burden associated with solvent use and industrial sources may be overestimated by all emission inventories. The agricultural waste burning emissions of some of the detected compound groups (ketones, aldehydes and acids) appear to be missing in the EDGARv4.3.2 inventory. © 2019 Author(s).

AB  - Background: Acyl-(acyl carrier protein (ACP)) reductase (AAR) is a key enzyme for hydrocarbon biosynthesis in cyanobacteria, reducing fatty acyl-ACPs to aldehydes, which are then converted into hydrocarbons by aldehyde-deformylating oxygenase (ADO). Previously, we compared AARs from various cyanobacteria and found that hydrocarbon yield in Escherichia coli coexpressing AAR and ADO was highest for AAR from Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 (7942AAR), which has high substrate affinity for 18-carbon fatty acyl-ACP, resulting in production of mainly heptadecene. In contrast, the hydrocarbon yield was lowest for AAR from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7336 (7336AAR), which has a high specificity for 16-carbon substrates, leading to production of mainly pentadecane. However, even the most productive AAR (7942AAR) still showed low activity; thus, residues within AAR that are nonconserved, but may still be important in hydrocarbon production need to be identified to engineer enzymes with improved hydrocarbon yields. Moreover, AAR mutants that favor shorter alkane production will be useful for producing diesel fuels with decreased freezing temperatures. Here, we aimed to identify such residues and design a highly productive and specific enzyme for hydrocarbon biosynthesis in E. coli. Results: We introduced single amino acid substitutions into the least productive AAR (7336AAR) to make its amino acid sequence similar to that of the most productive enzyme (7942AAR). From the analysis of 41 mutants, we identified 6 mutations that increased either the activity or amount of soluble AAR, leading to a hydrocarbon yield improvement in E. coli coexpressing ADO. Moreover, by combining these mutations, we successfully created 7336AAR mutants with ~ 70-fold increased hydrocarbon production, especially for pentadecane, when compared with that of wild-type 7336AAR. Strikingly, the hydrocarbon yield was higher in the multiple mutants of 7336AAR than in 7942AAR. Conclusions: We successfully designed AAR mutants that, when coexpressed with ADO in E. coli, are more highly effective in hydrocarbon production, especially for pentadecane, than wild-type AARs. Our results provide a series of highly productive AARs with different substrate specificities, enabling the production of a variety of hydrocarbons in E. coli that may be used as biofuels. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - In order to reduce the CO2 emissions in the transportation sector, one can electrify the vehicle, switch to biofuel, or capture and store CO2 on board. In this study, integration of an on board CO2 capture and storage unit with an internal combustion engine has been proposed. The technology can be applied for various internal combustion or Stirling engines with targeted applications in the transportation sector. Truck transport for goods delivery is used as an example for on board CO2 capture and storage system design. The investigated system integrates a temperature swing adsorption system for CO2 capture with a turbo-compressor system to compress and liquefy the captured CO2 using the waste heat of the exhaust gases of the engine. Energy and exergy analyses of the proposed CO2 captured system are studied in details. The CO2 capture system for engine exhaust stream (car, truck, bus, ship, or train) can capture 90% of the emitted CO2, without any energy penalty. This system can be integrated into overall mobility system (fuel-engine-CO2-fuel), where captured CO2 can be recycled as conventional liquid or gaseous fuels produced from renewable energy sources. © Copyright © 2019 Sharma and Maréchal.

AB  - As a promising renewable fuel, 2, 6, 10-trimethyl dodecane has received extensive attention. In order to deeply understand the combustion process of this fuel, its detailed chemical reaction mechanism is developed by using the reaction class method. The ignition delay time is verified using the detailed chemical reaction mechanism, and results show that the addi-tion of new reaction paths can improve the prediction accuracy in the low-temperature region. At the same time, the con-centration of important species in the flow reactor and the velocity of laminar flame propagation are also verified. The good agreement between simulated and experimental values proves the validity of the construction process of this chemi-cal reaction mechanism, which creates an opportunity to study the reaction flow process of fuels by simulations as well. ©2019, Editorial Office of the Journal of Combustion Science and Technology.

AB  - The continuous production of biodiesel is achieved through a sequence of stages such as reaction, absorption, decantation, and product distillation. These steps require certain performance criteria that must be optimized. Several works have addressed the optimization of the design of biodiesel plants, and these have usually examined modifications to the dimensions and types of equipment or energy integration. However, there is only limited literature available on determining optimal operating conditions for existing processes. In this paper, the steady-state optimization of a soybean continuous biodiesel plant is proposed. To this end, a mathematical model to describe the chemical kinetics of soybean oil transesterification was developed and incorporated into a chemical process simulator. The optimization procedure is based on multidimensional Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP), in which the primary objectives were to minimize the plant's energy consumption subject to a minimum of 99 wt% biodiesel purity. The results reveal that the optimization of the current process allows a 4.45% reduction in energy consumption compared to the base case. Besides, the study also evidenced that the optimization approach can be applied to recalculate the optimal point when possible disturbances can deviate the system from a steady state. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The effect of a new renewable paraffinic fuel on the combustion characteristics of a diesel engine was evaluated and compared to other fossil paraffinic fuel (GTL – Gas - To Liquid), to a Biodiesel (blend of soybean and palm oil) and a to a conventional fossil diesel (without Biodiesel). Five steady state modes were selected that cover the most part of the engine speed-torque map of the driving conditions established in the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). At the lowest engine load modes (A and C), the start of heat release occurs after main injection but at the other three modes (E, G and I) thermal conditions favor combustion of the pre-injection, the start of combustion escalating with the cetane number of the fuels. Biodiesel shows the lowest combustion duration, being the behavior of Farnesane similar only at high engine load conditions. Although Farnesane and GTL are paraffinic fuels, the combustion duration with the biofuel is more than 5° shorter in modes G and I although its start of combustion takes place earlier. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Nowadays biodiesel usage is widely adopted in internal combustion engine because of availability and lower exhaust emissions. During the biodiesel production around 10% glycerol is obtained as a byproduct, and this can be efficiently used in CI engines. In this paper the crude glycerol obtained from the trans-esterification process of biodiesel is used to produce hydrogen enriched syngas, through water mixture by directly injecting it into a fast thermal cracking reactor at different temperature such as 600 °C, 650 °C, 700 °C and 750 °C. The yield of syngas at different temperatures and different glycerol-water proportions are analyzed. It is seen that the addition of water has improved the syngas yield and also increased the proportion of hydrogen in the syngas up to 80%. Further the performance and emission study of the syngas in a compression ignition engine showed significant reduction in smoke and NO emission simultaneously. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The study evaluated the lipid accumulation potential of bacteria isolated from dairy effluent scum by the valorization of dairy wastewater as a renewable feedstock for biodiesel production. Three oleaginous bacteria (i.e. DS-1, DS-6, and DS-7) were screened on the basis of their lipid accumulation (>20% lipid content) and productivity on a glucose-based medium. The effect of different carbon sources (i.e. lactose, sucrose, starch, glucose, and xylose) on lipid accumulation capacity of the bacterial isolates was evaluated. The rod-shaped oleaginous bacterium DS-7 could accumulate 90% lipid with 1.2 g/l·d lipid productivity using lactose as a sole source of carbon. The bacteria could efficiently utilize dairy wastewater (~50% reduction in BOD) with reasonably high lipid accumulation (72.78%), biomass production (4.29 g/l) and lipid productivity (0.727 g/l·d). The lipids accumulated by bacterium DS-7 were mostly neutral lipids and contained fatty acids of chain length C14:0-C18:0, as confirmed by nile red staining and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and gas chromatography (GC) analysis of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) revealed that transesterified bacterial lipids from the isolated bacteria DS-7 are suitable for biodiesel applications. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The use of non-edible vegetable oils as diesel engine fuel is a green solution which fosters energy security and reduces dependency on fossil fuels. Canola and jatropha plant seeds were adopted in this study based on their different physicochemical properties. Transesterification was used to upgrade the seed-derived oils into diesel grade oil. The engine performance, combustion behavior and emissions associated with biodiesel and its blends were studied. Results showed that biofuels have better performance when compared to a diesel. Significant reduction in emissions even high engine loads was achieved. The performance analysis of the test results showed that the brake specific fuel consumption values were slightly higher compared to diesel. Due to the shortage in studying the engine performance and emissions using the CFD techniques, a home-made code, COMMENT code, has been developed for the solution of optimization problems related to development and operation of ICEs. According to the different statistical analysis, the results were in good agreement with the experimental data with an average error of 2.7%. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present research work comprises of the study of Momordica charantia (L.) seeds as an alternative for biodiesel production. A new source of heterogeneous catalyst: duck egg shell derived calcium oxide (CaO), as catalyst is used in the transesterification reaction. The catalyst has been synthesized and analyzed through X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transforms infrared spectrometer (FTIR) and the results were compared with works of other researchers. The MCME thus obtained is characterized through FTIR and Gas chromatograph-Mass spectrometer (GC-MS) for determining the fatty acid methyl ester composition and content. The yield of methyl ester using duck egg shell derived CaO was found to be 96.8%. The engine test at variable engine speed (1200, 1500 and 1800 rpm) and loading (low, medium and full) showed that use of B20 MCME has significant reduction in NOX emissions (51.68%, 55.88% &amp; 55.68% in 1200, 1400 and 1800 rpm) while other emission components- CO, CO2, PM and SO2 were close to that of diesel. Performance and combustion characteristics were observed to be lower than that of diesel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A process engineering strategy was developed for cultivation of high density biomass of Chlorella sp. FC2 with improved productivity under photoautotrophic condition. The process engineering strategy involved a combinatorial approach of: (i) optimization of CO2 concentration in the inlet gas stream &amp; aeration rate; (ii) growth kinetic driven feeding recipe for limiting nutrients; and (iii) dynamic increase in light intensity. The strategy was tested by growing the cells on laboratory grade BG11 medium. With an attempt to reduce the cultivation cost, the growth performance of the organism was then evaluated on commercial grade BG11 medium. Finally, hydrothermal liquefaction was carried out for direct conversion of microalgal slurry into bio-crude oil. Cultivation on laboratory grade BG11 medium resulted in biomass titer and overall productivity of 8.41 g L−1 and 575.9 mg L−1 day−1 respectively. Significant improvement in biomass titer (13.23 g L−1) and overall productivity (731.6 mg L−1 day−1) was observed when grown on commercial grade BG11 medium. Higher fraction of hydrocarbon in the bio-crude oil depicted better oil quality. Thermal gravimetric analysis revealed that maximum distillate fraction lies within the boiling point range of 200–300 °C which is suitable for conversion into diesel oil, jet fuel, and fuel for stoves. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The transverse relaxation time (T2), measured using a benchtop time-domain nuclear magnetic resonance (TD-NMR) relaxometer, was evaluated as a potential analytical method to quantify methanol as an adulterant in commercial ethanol. The T2 measurements, using the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill pulse sequence, can be performed in a non-destructive manner, within a few seconds and without sample preparation. The T2 value shows a linear correlation with methanol concentration in ethanol, capable of predicting the methanol adulteration with a high determination coefficient (r2 = 0.99). Therefore, TD-NMR can be used as simple, rapid, non-destructive and cheap analytical method to quantify the presence of methanol in ethanol fuel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, the auto-ignition of two polyoxymethylene dimethyl ethers, namely OME2 and OME3 (CH3–O–CH2–On–CH3 with n=2 and n=3 respectively), is investigated in a rapid compression machine (RCM). Ignition delay times (IDT) of stoichiometric OME2/air and OME3/air mixtures were measured for pressures ranging from 3 to 10 bar, and temperatures ranging between 570 and 690 K. The RCM data shows that already at these relatively low pressures and temperatures, both OME2 and OME3 auto-ignite within timescales that are well observed within RCM measurements. At the higher investigated pressures, OME2 and OME3 show nearly the same ignition delay time for all the investigated temperatures. In contrast, at lower pressures, the ignition delay time differ more, with OME3 showing longer ignition delay times. The pressure-dependence of ignition delay time exhibits a pronounced nonlinear behavior. We fitted a global Arrhenius equation to our ignition delay data near 10 bar, which well fits our data. Comparing our RCM results for OME2 and OME3 to simulations based on the reaction mechanism of He et al. [1], we found good agreement at a pressure of 10 bar. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The spray characteristics of biofuels have attracted broad interests, due to its bright prospect as one of the alternative fuels. The rheology of some biofuels was found to be power-law behavior. The spray performance of these fuels still remains unclear. Besides, biofuel atomization in pressurized gaseous crossflow can be of interest for combustion engines. The influential factors, namely the momentum flux ratios, Weber number and liquid-gas density ratios, are investigated employing controlling variable approach in the present. Power-law behavior fuel has shown great advantages in bringing a better atomization compared to the Newtonian one with case-control method. Jet column surface disturbance and the deformation magnitude during the injection process is emphasized. The penetration core lengths and breakup points are identified to illustrate the column deformation and breakup times. Besides, the column furcation processes which form finger-like features, as well as surface wavelengths are detected and compared along the studies of the influential factors. A larger injection momentum brings a smaller column deflection while the deflection is independent of Weber number. Besides, the locations of the furcation points increase with the raise of the momentum flux ratios while reduce with the increase of Weber number. The significant effect for increasing the density ratios is on promoting jet atomization. Column breakup processes tend to take place when keep increasing the gas densities. The column surface fluctuations are enhanced while the quantity of the ligaments raises and the shapes become richer. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The effects of traditional biodiesel (fatty acid methyl-esters, FAME) and a hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) were comprehensively investigated on a production Euro 6 diesel car, including fuel injection rate and timing, combustion analysis, emissions of regulated and unregulated pollutants, and regeneration of the diesel particle filter. The use of both biofuels is a part of the efforts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and health-relevant pollutants and to improve energy security and sustainability. HVO, albeit more expensive, offers benefits relative to FAME in terms of oxidation stability, injector fouling, energy content and cetane number. The car was fitted with an on-board instrumentation and subjected to a range of driving cycles on a chassis dynamometer. The fuel consumption calculated from instantaneous emissions data based on exhaust gas composition measured by an on-board FTIR and calculated exhaust flow matched directly measured fuel consumption within several percent on all fuels; differences in the consumption among the fuels correspond to different heating values. The combustion onset and maximum heat release rate were comparable for diesel and FAME but were advanced on HVO due to its higher cetane number, causing, at times, multiple distinct heat release peaks, suggesting that optimization of fuel injection timing for HVO might be beneficial. Emissions of methane and ammonia were negligible, of N2O were measurable and slightly lower for HVO than for other fuels, of formaldehyde were limited to cold engine accelerations and highest for FAME and negligible for HVO, of NO and NO2 were high on all fuels during all operating conditions except for the type approval test. The results confirm several relative advantages of HVO over RME, with penetration into engine lubricating oil during particle filter regeneration to be further investigated. The effects of HVO lubricity and other long-term effects were not evaluated here. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Nickel catalysts supported on palygorskite of varying Ni content were synthesized following the deposition–precipitation method. The catalysts were characterized using various techniques and evaluated in a semi-batch reactor for the transformation of waste cooking oils (WCO) into green diesel at 310 °C and hydrogen pressure 40 bar. The nickel nanoparticles supported on palygorskite were proved to be very active. The conversion of the WCO was about 100%. The green diesel content of the liquid product depends mainly on the nickel surface exposed per gram of catalyst, following a volcano like trend and maximized (81.9 wt %) over the sample with 30 wt % Ni. Taking into account the very high ratio of WCO volume to catalyst mass (100 mL/g) and that the evaluation of the catalysts was performed under solvent free conditions, these results demonstrate the successful use of mineral palygorskite for developing promising “natural catalysts” for green diesel production. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the recent past, esters of meium-chain fatty acis have receive much attention ue to their wie inustrial application, meicinal importance, an biofuel use as alternative to petroleum iesel. Therefore, in the present work the repercussion of meium-chain-length fatty acis (MCLFAs) (C6-C10) with various alcohols for the homogeneous catalyze esterification has been stuie. The esterification of the MCLFAs with istinct alcohols (n-PrOH, i-PrOH, an n-BuOH) has been stuie in etail in a batch reactor. The impacts of various factors such as the mole ratio of MCLFAs to istinct alcohol, catalyst concentration, an temperature have been stuie. A kinetic moel reveale that the esterification of MCLFAs with various alcohols can be explaine well by a pseuohomogeneous first-orer reaction. The rate of the reaction, activation energy, an frequency factors were estimate using Arrhenius plots. The reactivity an influence of carbon chain length of MCLFAs an the effect of branching of alcohols were investigate to fin out the maximum conversion of MCLFAs.

AB  - Efficient transformation of renewable biomass into chemicals and biofuels, including liquid biomass-derived nonedible oils to biodiesel, is of great importance. Developing heterogeneously functional materials is being deemed as a subject of particular interest to scientists in selective catalytic chemistry especially for biomass valorization. In this regard, porous polymers, featuring high surface areas, prominent stabilities, and chemically adjustable moieties, have attracted extensive concerns. In this Review, recent developments on the application of heterogeneously functionalized porous polymeric catalysts of high performance, including acid/base chemosynthetic organic polymers/natural biodegradable biopolymers like chitosan, organic-inorganic hybrid polymeric materials such as functional porous coordination polymers, and porous polymers immobilized with enzymes for effective upgrading of oil feedstocks into biodiesel are summarized. Catalytic protocols using functional polymeric catalysts provide significant benefits for realizing biorefinery procedures because of the following reasons: (i) no polluting reagents, (ii) high activities and selectivities, and (iii) simple and convenient catalyst recycling. Attention has been drawn, in particular, to understanding the role of acidity/basicity, hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, swelling property, and porosity of polymer materials in biodiesel production through transesterification and esterification reactions. In addition, plausible reaction mechanisms are also depicted accordingly, while highlighting the main remaining challenges and future prospects. Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: The hydrotreatment of oleochemical/lipid feedstocks is currently the only technology that provides significant volumes (millions of litres per year) of "conventional" biojet/sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). However, if biojet fuels are to be produced in sustainably sourced volumes (billions of litres per year) at a price comparable with fossil jet fuel, biomass-derived "advanced" biojet fuels will be needed. Three direct thermochemical liquefaction technologies, fast pyrolysis, catalytic fast pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction were assessed for their potential to produce "biocrudes" which were subsequently upgraded to drop-in biofuels by either dedicated hydrotreatment or co-processed hydrotreatment. Results: A significant biojet fraction (between 20.8 and 36.6% of total upgraded fuel volume) was produced by all of the processes. When the fractions were assessed against general ASTM D7566 specifications they showed significant compliance, despite a lack of optimization in any of the process steps. When the life cycle analysis GHGenius model was used to assess the carbon intensity of the various products, significant emission reductions (up to 74%) could be achieved. Conclusions: It was apparent that the production of biojet fuels based on direct thermochemical liquefaction of biocrudes, followed by hydrotreating, has considerable potential. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Biomass-derived furanyl ethers, such as 5-alkoxymethylfurfurals (AMFs) and 2,5-bis(alkoxymethyl)furans (BAMFs), can be employed as promising biofuels or additives. The development of multifunctional catalysts for the efficient production of furanyl ethers from sugars through 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) as an intermediate is highly desirable but challenging, because multiple reactions including dehydration, etherification and hydrogenation get involved and the side reaction of sugars and HMF to form humins is inevitable. In this contribution, we found that the introduction of CuO resulted in the generation of Lewis acid sites at the cost of Bronsted acid sites over CuO-USY catalysts through the formation of Al-O-Cu(II) species. The dispersity of CuO particles and the amount of Lewis acid sites could be manipulated by adjusting the loading of CuO. If 5 wt% CuO was supported on USY zeolite to give a CuO(5)-USY catalyst, CuO particles with a high dispersity (36.4%) afforded abundant Lewis acid sites (457.1 μmol/g). Lewis acid over CuO(5)-USY greatly promoted the acid-catalyzed dehydration of fructose to HMF and HMF etherification to AMFs, resulting in a HMF yield up to 86.2% from fructose and AMFs yields greater than 90% from HMF. Interestingly, a combination of CuO(5)-USY and a small amount of metallic Cu powder was able to offer desirable BAMFs yields by the reductive etherification of HMF under hydrogen atmosphere. As a result, 5-methoxymethylfurfural (MMF) of 79.6% and 2,5-bis(methoxymethyl)furan (BMMF) yield of 74.5% were achieved from fructose through HMF as an intermediate in the presence of CuO(5)-USY alone or with metallic Cu as a co-catalyst. Therefore, the above Cu-based catalyst system holds the promise to flexibly produce a family of AMFs or BAMFs from fructose via a facile two-step approach. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Potential land-use change impact has been of concern for producing biomass-derived fuels. To avoid displacing crop production, this study considered north central and western U.S. nonirrigated wheat-growing states for integration of oilseed that fits well into rotations with existing grain crops for renewable jet fuel production. We conducted analyses showing oilseed supply and natural resource impacts based on 2326 9 km × 9 km grid cells in the U.S. Northern Great Plains and further examined the cradle-to-grave environmental impact based on inputs taken from a collection of biogeochemical, hydrological, farmer behavior, and biomass logistics models. Life cycle assessment results from this study show that introducing oilseeds to existing crop rotations for coproduction of food and renewable jet fuel has significant advantages in terms of global-warming potential compared to fossil jet (88 g CO2 eq/MJ), with considerable soil carbon savings from replacing the fallow period. The greenhouse gas emissions can be as low as -235 to -349 g CO2eq per MJ of jet fuel using displacement allocation, and -55 to -107 g CO2eq per MJ jet fuel using energy allocation, over the price points from $400 to $800 per Mg of rapeseed. Total net revenue from this land transition also creates opportunities to boost fuel oilseeds production and farmer incomes. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The shortage of fossil resources and strict environmental regulations have ignited great efforts in the production of bio-based fuels and chemicals via biorefinery. Herein, considering the strong interaction between Ni and Mg species, we specially designed and prepared Ni/CaMgO and Ni/MgSiO for alkylation and hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reactions during the upgrading of the acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation mixture. Gratifyingly, the Mg-decorated catalysts exhibited great catalytic performance: a selectivity of 63.9% under a conversion of 94.2% was achieved for C8-C15 ketones and alcohols, which is higher than that over other heterogeneous alkali-based catalysts, and the obtained mixture was completely converted into the corresponding alkanes at 190 °C (H2 pressure: 1 MPa). It is worth noting that jet fuels or gasoline could be efficiently and selectively obtained by facile adjustment of the composition of the ABE fermentation product. Moreover, investigation on the structure-activity correlation confirmed that the outstanding activity of Ni/MgSiO for HDO could be attributed to the synergic catalysis between Ni0 and strong acid sites. The Ni/CaMgO and Ni/MgSiO catalysts reported in this work offer three advantages: selectively upgrading zymotic biomass wastes into biofuels, replacing the expensive noble metal (Pd) by the base metal (Ni), and realizing the HDO process under mild conditions and complying with the principles of "green chemistry". Overall, this work opens a new possibility for biofuel production, which is conductive to the rational design and implementation of highly active heterogeneous catalysts. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Methane (CH4) and bio alcohols have different ignition properties. These have been extensively studied and the resulting experimental data have been used to validate chemical kinetic models. Methane is the main component of natural gas, which is of interest because of its relative availability and lower emissions compared to other hydrocarbon fuels. Given growing interest in fuel-flexible systems, there can be situations in which the combustion properties of natural gas need to be modified by adding biofuels such as bio alcohols. This can occur in dual-fuel internal combustion engines or gas turbines with dual-fuel capabilities. The combustion behavior of such blends can be understood by studying the auto ignition properties in fundamental combustion experiments. Studies of the ignition of such blends are very limited in the literature. In this work, the auto ignition of methane and bio alcohol fuel blends is investigated using a shock tube facility. The chosen bio alcohols are ethanol (C2H5OH) and n-propanol (NC3H7OH). Experiments are carried out at 3 atm and 10 atm for stoichiometric and lean mixtures of fuel, oxygen, and argon. The ignition delay times of the pure fuels are first established at conditions of constant oxygen concentration and comparable pressures. The ignition delay times of blends with 50% methane are then measured. The pyrolysis kinetics of the blends is further explored by measuring CO formation during pyrolysis of the alcohol and methane-alcohol blends. The resulting experimental data are compared with the predictions of selected chemical kinetic models to establish the ability of these models to predict the disproportionate enhancement of methane ignition by the added alcohol. © 2019 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

AB  - To meet the increasingly strict emission limits imposed by regulations, internal combustion engines for transport applications require the urgent development of novel emission abatement systems. The introduction of biodiesel or other biofuels in the engine operation is considered to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, these alternative fuels can affect the performance of the post-combustion systems due to the variability they introduce in the exhaust particle distribution and their particular physical properties. Bioceramic materials made from vegetal waste are characterized by having an orthotropic hierarchical microstructure, which can be tailored in some way to optimize the filtration mechanisms as a function of the particle distribution of the combustion gases. Consequently, they can be good candidates to cope with the variability that new biofuel blends introduce in the engine operation. The objective of this work is to predict the filtration performance of a wall-flow particulate filter (DPF) made of biomorphic silicon carbide (bioSiC) with a systematic procedure that allows to eventually fit different fuel inputs. For this purpose; a well-validated DPF model available as commercial software has been chosen and adapted to the specific microstructural features of bioSiC. Fitting the specific filtration and permeability parameters of this biomaterial into the model; the filtration efficiency and pressure drop of the filter are predicted with sufficient accuracy during the loading test. The results obtained through this study show the potential of this novel DPF substrate; the material/microstructural design of which can be adapted through the selection of an optimum precursor. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - This research was carried out to evaluate utilisation of Ubi Gajah (Manihot esculenta), a non-edible cassava species, as a feedstock for bioethanol production by acid hydrolysis. The Ubi Gajah peels and pulp substrates were hydrolysed for a max. of 48 hrs with H2SO4 acid concentration ranges 5% v/v to 15% v/v at high temperature and pressure before fermentation process. While the yield was noted at 24 hr of 15% v/v acid hydrolysis. From the experimental results yield of bioethanol for Ubi Gajah Peel and Pulp 156.65 g/L and 220.89 g/L were noted respectively when both the substrates were hydrolysed with 15% v/v of H2SO4. The FTIR Spectra of the bioethanol, confirms –OH, C-O and C=C groups by absorption bands at 3251.98 cm-1 to 3315.63 cm-1; 1045.42 cm-1 and 1085.92 cm-1; and 1633.71 cm-1 and 1645.28 cm-1 respectively. The biofuel properties were tested according to ASTM standards and found to be complacent. The Bioethanol - diesel blends (BDB) of 5% to 20% v/v were prepared and fuel performance test was conducted on a diesel engine. The performance and emission results confirm suitability of the bioethanol as an alternative fuel. © 2019, Malaysian Society of Applied Biology. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, CuO was synthesized as a microwave absorber in the pyrolysis of a biomass model (sugarcane bagasse). CuO was synthesized for 5 min of irradiation using the following techniques: microwave (MW), ultrasound (US), combined mode (MW-US), and conduction heating (CH) as a reference material. The use of these treatments promotes changes in the morphology, as MW and US generate leaves and monolithic faceted morphologies, respectively. Changes were also generated in some textural characteristics such as crystal size, surface area, and volume-pore size. They were produced as a consequence of changes in the conditions during the crystallization stage produced by the different irradiation types. The microwave-assisted pyrolysis was performed aiming for the maximum liquid fraction (bio-oil) in the products. The reaction time, the size of the biomass, and the CuO synthesis method were also analyzed. The following particle size (ps) intervals were studied: ps &lt; 0.5 mm, 0.5 mm &lt; ps &lt; 1.7 mm, 1.7 mm &lt; ps &lt; 3.5 mm. The best conditions at 1160Watts in the microwave were: 4 min of reaction, particle size lower than 0.5 mm, and CuO synthesized by US. The use of CuO in the pyrolysis almost triples the amount of the obtained liquid fraction, when compared with the pyrolysis without the use of a microwave absorbent. The CuO was reduced to Cu2O and Cu after the pyrolysis. In this work, a reduction in the reaction times from hours to minutes was achieved during the synthesis of CuO and the pyrolysis biomass. The liquid fraction (bio-oil) can be raw material to obtain value-added chemical products or biofuels. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - This article presents a theoretical analysis of the use of spiral-elliptical ducts in the atomizer of a modern fuel injector. The parameters of the injected fuel stream can be divided into quantitative and qualitative. The quantitative parameter is the injection dose amount, and the qualitative parameter is characterized by the stream of injected fuel (width, atomization, opening angle, and range). The purpose of atomizer modification is to cause additional flow turbulence, which may affect the stream parameters and improve the combustion process of the combustible mixture in a diesel engine. The spiral-elliptical ducts discussed here could be used in engines powered by vegetable fuels. The stream of such fuels has worse quality parameters than conventional fuels, due to their higher viscosity and density. The proposal to use spiral-elliptical ducts is an innovative idea for diesel engines. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The production of biodiesel at the industrial level is mainly based on the use of basic catalysts. Otherwise, also acidic catalysis allowed high conversion and yields, as this method is not affected by the percentage of free fatty acids present in the starting sample. This work has been useful in assessing the possible catalytic pathways in the production of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), starting from different cooking waste oil mixtures, exploring particularly acidic catalysis. It was possible to state that the optimal experimental conditions required concentrated sulfuric acid 20% w/w as a catalyst, a reaction time of twelve hours, a temperature of 85◦ C and a molar ratio MeOH/oil of 6:1. The role of silica in the purification method was also explored. By evaluating the parameters, type of catalyst, temperature, reaction time and MeOH/oil molar ratios, it has been possible to develop a robust method for the production of biodiesel from real waste mixtures with conversions up to 99%. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The catalytic hydrogenation of lignocellulosic derived bio-oil was assessed from the thermodynamic simulation perspective, in order to evaluate its economic potential for the production of added-value chemicals and drop-in fuels. A preliminary economic evaluation was first run to identify the conditions where the process is profitable, while a full economic analysis evaluated how the operating conditions affected the reaction in terms of yield. The results indicate that the bio-oil should be separated into water-soluble and insoluble fractions previous hydrogenation, since very different process conditions are required for the two portions. The maximum economic potential resulted in 38,234 MM$/y for a capacity of bio-oil processed of 10 Mt/y. In the simulated biorefinery, the insoluble bio-oil fraction (IBO) was processed to produce biofuels with a cost of 22.22 and 18.87 $/GJ for light gasoline and diesel, respectively. The water-soluble bio-oil fraction (WBO) was instead processed to produce 51.43 ton/day of chemicals, such as sorbitol, propanediol, butanediol, etc., for a value equal to the market price. The economic feasibility of the biorefinery resulted in a return of investment (ROI) of 69.18%, a pay-out time of 2.48 years and a discounted cash flow rate of return (DCFROR) of 19.11%, considering a plant cycle life of 30 years. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The depletion of conventional energy sources, including crude oil, is one of the cause of the search for alternative carriers and fuels in order to prevent an energy crisis. Due to the progressing climate change, each new solution must comply with the principles of sustainable development. Dynamic development in the transport sector and, as a consequence, the increase in the number of vehicles on the roads negatively affect the atmosphere and the environment, which is why the share of biofuels, which are used to minimize this negative impact, is steadily increasing. This paper analyzes the emissivity (emission capability) of biofuels such as fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), ethanol, dimethyl ether and butanol and compares them with conventional fuels. A computer simulation was used, based on the real parameters of vehicles and fuels. The test procedure was carried out in accordance with the appropriate New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) approval test for such cars. In addition, a life cycle assessment (LCA) for the fuels and vehicles in question was carried out using the Sima Pro package. Based on the results obtained from the z computer simulation, it was found that diesel fuel showed lower emissivity than petrol and its alternatives. However, FAME fuel provided more carbon dioxide than conventional diesel. As far as petrol is concerned, it was less emissive than dimethyl ether. Ethanol and butanol reduced emissions by 7% and 15%, respectively. After taking into account CO2 emissions generated in the production process, both FAME and butanol were not very favorable in the context of other fuels. The results might be used for appropriate fuel use management. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The combination of wastewater treatment and biodiesel production using algal cultivation was studied in the present work. The two main goals of the work were achieved by the cultivation of freshwater microalgae such as Chlamydomonas sp., Scenedesmus ecornis, and Scenedesmus communis in two different dilutions of fertilizer plant wastewater (FWWD1 and FWWD2) collected from Yara Suomi Oy, Finland. The growth pattern of different algal species in FWWD1 and FWWD2 was observed. The effect of pH on biomass concentration, lipid content, biomass productivity, and lipid productivity by all three algal species in FWWD1 and FWWD2 were monitored. The maximum biomass concentration and productivity were observed in FWWD1 at pH7.5 for Chlamydomonas sp. and at pH 8.5 for S. ecornis and S. communis. The maximum lipid content was detected in Chlamydomonas sp at pH5.5, followed by S. ecornis and then S. communis at pH 7.5 in FWWD2 obtained after co-solvent extraction method. The most significant removal percentage of COD by all algal species were observed in FWWD1, whereas the highest removal percentage of TN and TP were detected in FWWD2, respectively. The fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) characterization of each algal species in FWWD1 and FWWD2 at their optimum pH was investigated to determine the quality of obtained biodiesel. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - The application of fuels from renewable energy sources for combustion engine powering involves a great demand for this kind of energy while its production infrastructure remains underdeveloped. The use of this kind of fuel is supposed to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and the depletion of natural resources and to increase the share of renewable energy sources in total energy consumption and thus support sustainable development in Europe. This study presents the results of research on selected performance parameters of transport by internal combustion engines including: power, torque, the emission of sound generated by the engine, the content of exhaust components (oxygen O2, carbon monoxide CO, carbon dioxide CO2, nitrogen dioxide NO2), and the content of particulate matter (PM) in exhaust emission. Three self-ignition engines were tested. The fuel injection controllers of the tested internal combustion engines were additionally adjusted by increasing the fuel dose and the load of air. The material used in the tests were mixtures of diesel oil and fatty acid methyl esters of dierent concentration. A statistical analysis was performed based of the results. The purpose of the work was to develop a resulting model for assessing the operation of engines fueled with biofuel and diesel mixtures while changing the vehicle's computer software. A computer simulation algorithm was also developed for the needs of the tests which was used to prognose the state of the test results for variable input parameters. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Abstract: The processes of oxidative depolymerization and acidic hydrolysis have consistently been used for the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass (wheat straw, sawdust, and lignin), which makes it possible to obtain a high content of soluble organic compounds in the hydrolysate (44–94 g COD/L) and to enhance the concentration of reducing sugars from 1 to 36%. The introduction of Clostridium acetobutylicum bacteria to an acidogenic biocatalyst resulted in an even greater increase in the content of volatile fatty acids and ethanol in the end product. The maxima among the studied substrates yields of butyric acid and ethanol were observed when the pretreated straw was hydrolyzed (27% (0.82 g/L) and 17.4% (0.44 g/L), respectively). It was shown that the addition of glycerol as a substrate makes it possible to increase the yields of butyric and acetic acids as a result of the conversion of the pretreated biomass; the addition of glycerol to straw in a 1 : 1 ratio enhanced the maximum butyric acid and VFA yields up to 32% (0.96 g/L) and 72% (2.67 g/L), respectively. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

AB  - In this work, the effect of different concentrations of CO2 (0.03, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10%) was evaluated on the generation of biomass, the productivity of lipids, the consumption of nitrate and phosphate, the lipid profile, and the quality of biodiesel obtained by Monoraphidium contortum. The maximum productivity of biomass (529.26 mg·L− 1·d− 1) and of lipids (37.52 mg·L− 1·d− 1) was obtained by M. contortum with 7.5% CO2. The lipids were transformed to biodiesel through a transesterification reaction; the major components of biodiesel obtained from M. contortum oil were oleic and palmitic acid. Fuel properties were estimated and found to be within the limits for biodiesel of the American Standard for Testing Materials (ASTM 6751:2006) and the European Union Standards (EN 14214:2008). The results obtained with M. contortum in this study justify its transformation into biodiesel of adequate quality. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The catalytic co-pyrolysis of grape seeds and waste tyres for the production of high-quality bio-oils was studied in a pilot-scale Auger reactor using different low-cost Ca-based catalysts. All the products of the process (solid, liquid, and gas) were comprehensively analysed. The results demonstrate that this upgrading strategy is suitable for the production of better-quality bio-oils with major potential for use as drop-in fuels. Although very good results were obtained regardless of the nature of the Ca-based catalyst, the best results were achieved using a high-purity CaO obtained from the calcination of natural limestone at 900 °C. Specifically, by adding 20 wt% waste tyres and using a feedstock to CaO mass ratio of 2:1, a practically deoxygenated bio-oil (0.5 wt% of oxygen content) was obtained with a significant heating value of 41.7 MJ/kg, confirming its potential for use in energy applications. The total basicity of the catalyst and the presence of a pure CaO crystalline phase with marginal impurities seem to be key parameters facilitating the prevalence of aromatisation and hydrodeoxygenation routes over the de-acidification and deoxygenation of the vapours through ketonisation and esterification reactions, leading to a highly aromatic biofuel. In addition, owing to the CO2-capture effect inherent to these catalysts, a more environmentally friendly gas product was produced, comprising H2 and CH4 as the main components. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Brines from table olive elaboration were co-digested with pig manure, obtaining high methane productions. In particular, the methane yields obtained for pig manure total solid (TS) initial concentrations of 2%, 7%, 9% (wet basis, wt.) were 106, 213 and 247 mL CH4 gVS-1 add, respectively, using mixtures of two types of brine (acid (A) and basic (B)) generated in the elaboration process. Moreover, an experiment with only basic brine was made, using a pig manure TS concentration of 7% wt. In this case, a methane yield of 224 mL CH4 gVS-1 add was obtained. The methane production rate was calculated in experiments of 7% pig manure TS concentration and a high kinetic constant of 0.31 d-1 was obtained for the mixture of residual brine. Finally, the effect of Na+ cation concentration was evaluated in the mixture A:B during co-digestion processes with a 7% wt. pig manure TS concentration and inhibition was detected in this process with a [Na+] of 0.56% wt. of the total sample. An energy and economical study on the treatment of these wastewaters by means of anaerobic co-digestion demonstrated a great economic benefit for the producer industry, a reduction in the diesel consumption used to produce its energetic demand and a reduction cost of 3.63 €/m3 generated of A:B brines mixture with ratio 2:1. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In this work, sodium titanate nanotubes were prepared by a hydrothermal method for 23 h at 160 °C and characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) methods, and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The obtained nanotubes were used as catalysts in the transesterification of pure and cooked oils under different experimental conditions (molar ratio, temperature, catalyst weight, and time). The catalyst showed high efficiency depending on the chosen conditions. The biodiesel yield was found to be 95.9% at 80 °C for 2 h. The catalyst also showed high activity for cooked oil conversion, with yields of 96.0, 96.0, and 93.58% for the first, second, and third uses of oil, respectively. The methanol was recycled and used in another transesterification experiment, and the biodiesel yield reached 91%. Density functional theory, Monte Carlo simulation, and molecular dynamics simulation were employed to clearly understand the transesterification mechanism. The transesterification reaction is represented by a pseudo-first-order kinetics model. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The replacement of fossil-based fuels by renewable fuels (biofuels) was proposed in the IPCC report, as an alternative to reduce greenhouse gas emission and reach out to a low-carbon economy. On this perspective, the Brazilian government had implemented a renewable energy program based on the use of ethanol in the transport sector. This work evaluates the scenario of pollutant gas emissions and particulate material that comes from the biomass burning process involved in ethanol production cycle, in the city of Campos dos Goytacazes, Brazil. The gases and particulate material emitted by sugarcane and bagasse burning processes—the last one in energy co-generation mills—were analyzed. A laboratory-controlled burning of both samples was realized in an oven with temperature ramp from 250 to 400 °C, at a regular rate of 50 °C. The gas samples were collected directly from the oven’s exhaust pipe. The particulates obtained were the residual material taken out of the burned samples: a powder with the aspect of soot. A photoacoustic spectroscopy system coupled with quantum cascade laser and electrochemical analyzers was used to measure the emission of polluting gases such as N2O, CO2, CO, NOx (NO, NO2), and SO2 in ppmv range. Fluorescent X-ray spectrometry was applied to evaluate the chemical composition of particulate material, enabling the identification of elements such as Si, Al, Ca, K, Fe, S, P, Ti, Mn, Cu, Zn, Sc, V, Cu, and Sr. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Life cycle thinking is a necessary component in preventing the shifting of burden along the life cycle and from one impact category to another. For this reason, many have focused on integrating life cycle thinking into occupational risk assessment. The resultant methods have different properties in terms of scope and outcomes. Literature has been reviewed for life cycle occupational risk assessment methodologies, and 3 methods (life cycle inherent toxicity (LCIT) method, work environment characterization factors (WE-CFs) method, and life cycle risk assessment (LCRA) method) have been selected and applied in a case study of electricity production from pyro-oil to identify suitability and research gaps in the existing literature. The results of the LCIT method were highly heterogenous over life cycle of electricity production. For the current case, the major cancer and non-cancer impacts originated from the same life cycles. The results from WE-CFs method were highly heterogenous over the life cycle of electricity production as well. Agriculture contributed the most to the occupational risks. In the LCRA method, averaging caused the information about the frequency of the risks over life cycle to be lost. The method showed the well-known bargaining between accuracy and simplicity when complex systems are considered. Results from this method were quite homogenous among life cycles, due to the averaging effect. Detailed reporting and follow-up of the worker health issues can enable a more accurate application of the WE-CFs method. The overall results showed that it was possible to apply these 3 methodologies for the EU-28 region. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The biodegradable portion of solid waste generated in farmhouses can be treated for energy recovery with small portable biogas plants. This action can be done across the Netherlands and all around the planet. This study aims to appraise the performance of anaerobic digestion of different wastes (cow manure, food waste and garden waste) obtained from a regional farmhouse. Batch reactors were established under mesophilic conditions in order to investigate the impact of ternary mixtures on the anaerobic digestion process performance. Different mixing ratios were set in the batch tests. The upshots from the experiments connoted that ternary digestion with cow manure:food waste:garden waste mixing ratio of 40:50:10 yielded higher biogas amount. The kinetics’ results showed quite good congruence with the experimental study. The results from the kinetic analysis appeared to be in line with the experimental one. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Removal of water from diesel fuel is essential to ensure efficient operation of High-Pressure Common-Rail (HPCR) fuel injection systems used in modern diesel engines. The presence of surfactants in modern fuels (including biofuels) can create conditions in which the interfacial tension between water and fuel is reduced, leading to coalescing media being “disarmed” and less effective in separation. To elucidate this phenomenon in industrially available depth coalescing media, the coalescence efficiency of surface-modified poly (butylene terephthalate) (PBT) meltblown nonwoven fabrics possessing a wide range of wetting behaviours was studied. Tuning of the wettability was accomplished by alkaline hydrolysis of the medium. Using reference grade diesel fuel with and without added surfactants, the coalescence efficiency and quality factor were studied by means of a purpose-built coalescence test rig. The coalescence efficiency was found to depend on both the fuel composition and the wettability of the treated PBT and the optimum efficiency for each test fuel required a difference in wettability of the PBT. For reference grade diesel, increasing the wettability to ‘intermediate’ level improved coalescence efficiency, but the quality factor can be negatively affected by water droplet retention within the medium. The reduced quality factor associated with hydrophilic media was even more pronounced in fuels containing surfactants due to increased pressure drop and re-emulsification of the fuel in water. These findings highlight the practical challenges that exist in engineering a “universal” coalescing medium suitable for removing water from diesel fuels containing surfactants, based solely on the modulation of fibre wettability and hydrophilicity. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - In this experimental work, the performance, combustion and emission characteristics of a novel peppermint oil blends are evaluated at different load conditions in a direct injection diesel engine without any engine modifications. The peppermint blend proportions are named as P10, P20, P30 and P40 based on the ratio of the peppermint oil in the diesel fuel. Suitability of the selected novel peppermint oil blends is determined based on its physical and chemical properties. The number of experimental trials is conducted at different load conditions; from the results, it is found that Brake thermal efficiency of P20 (31.89%) is comparatively better than conventional diesel fuel at full-load condition. Considering the emission aspects at full-load condition, reduction in smoke emission values was observed for all peppermint blends compared to diesel fuel. The smoke emission values are 51.0, 49.1, 43.6, 41.9 and 52.8 HSU for P10, P20, P30, P40 and diesel, respectively. However, the oxides of nitrogen emission are higher than those of diesel fuel at full-load condition. Through combustion analysis, it was observed that all the peppermint blends exhibit higher ignition delay compared to conventional diesel fuel. From this study, it is evident that the selected novel peppermint oil has meritorious advantages over conventional diesel fuel in terms of performance and emission. © 2019, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - Safflower plant is a promising energy crop, which is compatible with arid and semi-arid climate conditions. This study is set to perform a techno-economic assessment of an integrated biorefinery located in Iran, using safflower seed and safflower straw as feedstock for production of bioethanol as the main product, biodiesel as the most valuable byproduct while biogas, glycerol, solid residue, and sodium sulfate are the other valuable byproducts. In the first Scenario (A), glucose, xylose, and arabinose are fermented into ethanol by using Zymomonas mobilis produced in a seed train unit. While in the other Scenario (B), Saccharomyces cerevisiae is supplied externally by a yeast production facility and is used to ferment glucose into ethanol. Both scenarios are simulated using Aspen Plus software and a cash flow analysis is performed using well-known economic indices for the biofuel industry presented by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The profitability index is 1.14 for Scenario A, showing its cost-effectiveness. However, this index is found to be 0.81 for Scenario B, revealing the fact that this approach is not economically-justified for implementation. More specifically, the use of Z. mobilis instead of S. cerevisiae as fermenting microorganism enhances the profitability of the project by lowering ethanol production cost from 0.12 $/L to 0.09 $/L and minimum ethanol selling price from 0.67 $/L to 0.43 $/L. Moreover, in both scenarios, biodiesel production boosts the total annual sale values by 39% and 55% for scenario A and B, respectively. In general, 1.86 and 2.44 times improvements in this economic index are respectively obtained for scenario A and B because of byproduct credits. The outcomes of sensitivity analysis also shows that the discount factor and safflower seed price have large impacts on the profitability of the developed biorefineries. Overall, Z. mobilis appears to be a preferred biocatalyst for bioethanol fermentation through the biorefinery platform from the techno-economic viewpoint. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The study demonstrates a sustainable process for production of bio-crude oil via hydrothermal liquefaction of microbial biomass generated through co-cultivation of microalgae and bacteria coupled with wastewater remediation. Biomass concentration and wastewater treatment efficiency of a tertiary consortium (two microalgae and two bacteria) was evaluated on four different wastewater samples. Total biomass concentration, total nitrogen and COD removal efficiency was found to be 3.17 g L−1, 99.95% and 95.16% respectively when consortium was grown using paper industry wastewater in a photobioreactor under batch mode. Biomass concentration was enhanced to 4.1 g L−1 through intermittent feeding of nitrogen source and phosphate. GC-MS and FTIR analysis of bio-crude oil indicates abundance of the hydrocarbon fraction and in turn, better oil quality.

AB  - To explore the feasibility of scaling up hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of algal biomass, a pilot-scale continuous flow reactor (CFR) was operated to produce bio-crude oil from algal biomass cultivated in urban wastewater. The CFR system ran algal slurry (5 wt.% solids loading) at 350 °C and 17 MPa for 4 h without any clogging issues. Bio-crude oil chemistry was characterized by high-resolution Fourier transform mass spectroscopy (FT-MS), proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR), bomb calorimetry, and elemental analysis. Bio-crude oil yield of 28.1 wt% was obtained with higher heating values of 38–39 MJ/kg. The quality of light bio-crude oil produced from the CFR system was comparable in terms of molecular structures to bio-crude oil produced in a batch reactor. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Limited access to energy has led to interest in biofuels in most West African countries where Jatropha curcas (jatropha) has been the most widely studied energy crop. However, due to difficulties in obtaining enough jatropha seed at acceptable costs, Balanites aegyptiaca (B. aegyptiaca) could be an alternative feedstock for biofuel production at lower costs. We report the results of a comparative study of the optimal supply cost and supply network configuration of a cultivated and a wild energy crop. These optimal items were determined using a mixed integer linear programming model designed to help decision making concerning biomass supply chains for biofuel production. The model was applied to a case study on jatropha and B. aegyptiaca seed supply chains in Burkina Faso. By considering different options for location and technologies used for pre-processing as well as different cropping systems for jatropha cultivation, the case study showed that in contexts like those found in Burkina Faso, a wild energy crop like B. aegyptiaca cannot be competitive compared to cultivated energy crops like jatropha because of its costly logistic operations. © 2019 International Energy Initiative

AB  - Scenedesmus raciborskii WZKMT was subjected to fed-batch enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation to facilitate the saccharification of high-solid-loading substrate for high-concentration ethanol. In this work, process factors affecting enzymatic hydrolysis, including enzyme loading, temperature, pH, and solid loading, were optimized. Results showed that 58.03 g L−1 glucose, 12.57 g L−1 xylose, and 1.45 g L−1 cellobiose were obtained after the enzymatic hydrolysis of 330 g L−1 substrates under the optimal conditions of 30 FPU g−1 enzyme loading, 50 °C, and pH 5.5. Meanwhile, 89.60% yield and 30.43 g L−1 content of ethanol were obtained after the fermentation of 330 g L−1 hydrolysate. The maximum ethanol concentration of 79.38 g L−1 could be achieved through repeated fed-batch process, indicating that S. raciborskii WZKMT is a promising feedstock for ethanol production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The air pollution of conventional fuels, increases the tendency to alternative cleaner fuels like biodiesel fuels. Biodiesel is an expensive fuel and can be used as an additive to reduce levels of particulates, carbon monoxide, and other pollutants released from diesel fuel. The proportion of biodiesel in the produced fuel can be planned and controlled according to the conditions. This study forms a comprehensive multi-objective-period model for designing a biodiesel development program and compares different biodiesel blends and primary resources. The study considers B5, B10, B20, B40, and B100 along with diesel as the candidate fuels for demand fulfillment; furthermore, model considers waste cooking oil, soya, sunflower, and rapeseed as the primary resources. The objectives are the facilities' implementation costs and environmental effects minimization. The decision variables are the capacity planning and the facility location variables. The exact Pareto set is obtained by using the augmented e-constraint method. The study considers economic and environment objectives interactions. Based on the results, B5 and B40 are the most appropriate options in the exact Pareto set; moreover, the results show the advantages of this approach to select the most appropriate fuels and primary resources according to different conditions during the studied period. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Di-n-butyl ether (DBE) is one of the most promising alternative biofuels for vehicles due to its superior physicochemical properties and because it is a renewable resource. This study investigated the effects of DBE addition on the spray macroscopic characteristics of diesel-biodiesel blends under various injection and ambient conditions. Three kinds of ternary blended fuels were prepared - (1) 72% diesel, 18% biodiesel, 10% DBE by volume (D72B18DBE10); (2) 64% diesel, 16% biodiesel, 20% DBE by volume (D64B16DBE20); and (3) 56% diesel, 14% biodiesel, and 30% DBE by volume (D56B14DBE30) - in order to compare their spray characteristics with those of an 80% diesel-20% biodiesel mix (D80B20) and conventional diesel (D100). The experiments were conducted in a constant volume chamber with a high-pressure common rail injection system using a high-speed photography method. The results show that D80B20 gives the longest spray tip penetration and the smallest cone angle and projected area among the five test fuels. With increased DBE blending ratio, the spray penetration length decreases slightly, and spray cone angle and projected area increase. When the DBE volume fraction in the ternary blend is 20%, the spray tip penetration, cone angle, and projected area are comparable to those of diesel. In addition, air entrainment characteristics were analyzed with the quasi-steady jet theory. It was found that the addition of DBE can improve the air entrainment characteristics of diesel-biodiesel blends, and D64B16DBE20 results in fuel-air mixing similar to that of D100. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - In this study, biodiesel was produced by using a heterogeneous acid catalyst made from brewer's spent yeast (BSY). BSY was initially activated by phosphoric acid followed by carbonization in inert atmosphere and sulfonation process to prepare the catalyst. It is completely characterized using sophisticated instruments to determine its physical and chemical properties. Subsequently, the effectiveness of the catalyst was analyzed by subjecting it to sonochemical esterification of an industrial low value waste product, palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD). The reactions were performed in the presence of ultrasound at a constant frequency of 25 kHz. An optimum methyl ester conversion of 87.8% was achieved at 8 wt% of catalyst, 21:1 methanol to PFAD molar ratio, 65 °C and 180 min of reaction time. The catalyst displayed a high catalytic stability up to four cycles due to firm [sbnd]SO3H functional group attached onto the surface. Furthermore, a novel sonochemical kinetic model was proposed for surface esterification reaction on the catalyst. The reaction rate was found and it followed a pseudo-first-order reaction mechanism. Furthermore, a deactivation model was also proposed to account for the loss of activity upon catalyst reuse during sonochemical reaction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper aims to develop novel hydrophilic ionic liquid membranes using pervaporation for the recovery of biobutanol. Multiple polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) membranes based on three commercial ionic liquids with different loading were prepared for various experimental trials. The ionic liquids selected for the study include tributyl (tetradecyl) phosphonium chloride ([TBTDP][Cl]), tetrabutyl phosphonium bromide ([TBP][Br]) and tributyl methyl phosphonium methylsulphate ([TBMP][MS]). The synthesized membranes were characterized and tested in a custom-built pervaporation set-up. All ionic liquid membranes showed better results with total flux of 1.58 kg/m2h, 1.43 kg/m2h, 1.38 kg/m2h at 30% loading of [TBP][Br], [TBMP][MS] and [TBTDP][Cl] respectively. The comparison of ionic liquid membranes revealed that by incorporating [TBMP]MS to PVA matrix resulted in a maximum separation factor of 147 at 30 wt% loading combined with a relatively higher total flux of 1.43 kg/m2h. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also carried out to evaluate the experimental observations along with theoretical studies. The improved permeation properties make these phosphonium based ionic liquid a promising additive in PVA matrix for butanol-water separation under varying temperature conditions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work investigated the application of a thermophilic (55 °C) anaerobic reactor with immobilized biomass, mechanically stirred and operated in sequential batch and fed batch (AnSBBR) for environmental compliance and methane production by co-digesting cheese whey (W) and sugarcane vinasse (V). The assays were performed in four steps. In the first step the composition of 75%W:25%V (on a COD basis) was determined to be the most adequate for the anaerobic process. In the second step the applied volumetric organic load (AVOL) was increased and in the third step the feed strategy was modified achieving best results at AVOL of 25 gCOD.m−3.d−1, in which the removed organic matter efficiency was 72%, the molar productivity was 278 molCH4.m−3.d−1 and methane yield was 15.3 mmolCH4.gCOD−1. In the fourth step the temperature was modified to 50 °C and 45 °C, achieving worse results. From the kinetic model adjusted to experimental data it was identified that the acetoclastic route was predominant in methane generation. The estimated energy recovered by co-digesting cheese whey and sugarcane vinasse using industrial information was 2.2 × 104 MW h per month, equivalent (in Brazil) to the electricity consumption of about 135 × 103 inhabitants or monthly savings of US$ 1,653,000 replacing the diesel oil consumed in the industry. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The attributes of environmental balance, lower exhaust emission and renewability have made ethylic biodiesel production a preferable technique to methylic biodiesel production from inedible lipid oil. Hydrodynamic cavitation reactor (HCR), in particular has engaged a global interest due to its flexibility and desirable biodiesel properties. For the first time, the study adopted HCR to produce ethyl esters (biodiesel) from low FFA rubber seed oil (RSO). The effects of transesterification variables namely catalyst dosage (KOH) (3–5 wt.%), reaction time (30–50 min) and ethanol/RSO molar ratio (3.5 7.0) were examined on the biodiesel yield. The yield of rubber seed oil ethyl ester (RSOEE) (92.5%) was the highest at the ethanol/oil molar ratio of 6/1, KOH of 4.5 wt.% and reaction time of 40 min. The cavitational yield for RSOEE production in the cavitation reactor was 4.13 g/J. The fuel properties of the RSO ethyl esters synthesized from the HCR were within the ranges of the ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 specifications. However, the oxidation stability (OS) did not comply with the standards. To further improve the low OS, the antioxidant can be included in the RSOEE to enhance the OS to an acceptable limit (> 6 h). Therefore, the HCR can be a feasible reactor for the production of cleaner and renewable fuel from various feedstocks. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To reduce the amount of carbon dioxide released from transportation the EU has implemented legislation to mandate the renewable content of petrol and diesel fuels. However, due to the complexity of the combustion process the addition of renewable content, such as biodiesel and ethanol, can have a detrimental effect on other engine emissions. In particular the engine load can have a significant impact on the emissions. Most research that have studied this issue are based on steady state tests that are unrealistic of real world driving and will not capture the difference between full and part loads. This study aims to address this by investigating the effect of renewable fuel blends of diesel, biodiesel and ethanol on the emissions of a compression ignition engine tested over the World Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP). Diesel, biodiesel and ethanol were blended to form binary and ternary blends, the ratios were determined by Design of Experiments (DoE). The total amount of emissions for CO, CO2 and NOx as well as the fuel consumption, were measured from a 2.4 L compression ignition (CI) engine running over the WLTP drive cycle. The results depicted that percentages smaller than 10% of ethanol in the fuel blend can reduce CO emissions, CO2 emissions as well as NOx emissions, but increases fuel consumption with increasing percentage of ethanol in the fuel blend. Blends with biodiesel resulted in minor increases in CO emissions due to the engine being operated in the low and medium load regions over the WLTP. CO2 emissions as well as NOx emissions increased as a result of the high oxygen content in biodiesel which promoted better combustion. Fuel consumption increased for blends with biodiesel as a result from biodiesel's lower heating value. All the statistical models describing the engine responses were significant and this demonstrated that a mixture DoE is suitable to quantify the effect of fuel blends on an engine's emissions response. An optimised ternary blend of B2E9 was found to be suitable as a ’drop in’ fuel that will reduce harmful emissions of CO emissions by approximately 34%, NOx emissions by 10% and CO2 emissions by 21% for transient engine operating scenarios such as the WLTP drive cycle. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A completely immobilized cell-free enzyme reaction system was used to convert ketoisovaleric acid to isobutanol, a desirable biofuel, with a molar yield of 43% and a titer of 2 g/L, which are comparable to high performing in vivo systems (e.g. 41% and 5.4 g/L, respectively, for Clostridium thermocellum). The approach utilizes, for the first time, a series of previously reported enzyme mutants that either overproduce the product or are more stable when compared with their wild type. The selected enzyme variants include keto-acid decarboxylase attached to a maltose binding protein, alcohol dehydrogenase, and formate dehydrogenase. These enzymes were screened for thermal, pH, and product stability to choose optima for this system which were pH 7.4 and 35 °C. This system is designed to address well-known limitations of in vivo systems such as low product concentrations due to product feedback inhibition, instability of cells, and lack of economic product recovery. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Diesel engines are one of the most widespread internal combustion engines in the world. However, the requirements of the Environmental saving and decreasing in fossil fuels quality demand on searching the alternative fuel composition, which will be more environmentally friendly. Using different Biofuels allows decreasing the impact on the environment. There are a lot of researches devoted to the investigation of different plant oils as additives to diesel fuel. However, most of them are limited to standard engine parameters investigation. Nowhere was an attempt to evaluate the efficiency of the engine in terms of energy conversion. An experimental investigation has been carried out to analyze the combustion characteristics and thermal efficiency of a diesel engine at constant engine speed fuelled with diesel and its blends (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50%) with linseed oil. The methodology for the determination of the thermal efficiency of the thermodynamic cycle was developed. The results show the effect of the amount of linseed oil in the blends with pure diesel has non-monotonous behavior. The best combustion characteristics and energy conversion efficiency were observed with 20% of the linseed oil share. The worst combination is the blend of 30% linseed oil and of 70% pure diesel. The results mean that the addition of the linseed oil to the fuel mixture has an ambiguous influence on engine performance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Global energy demand is increasing every day and most is still derived from non-renewable sources. Therefore, sustainable alternatives are sought to produce biofuels, such as biodiesel. Several studies have demonstrated the potential of microalgae and cyanobacteria to produce biodiesel and pigments. These pigments, such as lutein and astaxanthin, have a high commercial value and can economically support the production of biodiesel. However, few studies have explored the potential of cyanobacteria collected in thermal water. In these microorganisms, both biomass and metabolites production can be altered by the culture form. Thus, a cosmopolitan filamentous cyanobacterium (Geitlerinema amphibium) from thermal water was collected and isolated to evaluate its potential to produce fatty acids, biodiesel, and pigments in two culture media. G. amphibium was cultured in WC (Wright's Cryptophyte) and BBM (Bold’s Basal Medium) media. Thermal stress (40 °C for 48 h) was applied to the medium, which generated higher productivity of the biomass in BBM. The cyanobacterium contained higher biodiesel content in the WC medium and higher pigment content in the BBM medium. Thermal stress increased the biodiesel content by 350%, but decreased pigment content. Two pigments with high commercial value (astaxanthin and lutein) were identified. G. amphibium produced up to 2.74 mg g−1 of astaxanthin and 5.49 mg g−1 of lutein, which is seven times more lutein than Marigold, currently the main raw material used commercially. Therefore, G. amphibium has the potential to produce biodiesel, astaxanthin, and lutein concomitantly. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Direct field emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) may determine whether biodiesel from oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) fulfills the EU requirement of at least 50% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions as compared to fossil diesel. However, only few studies have documented fertilizer N emission factors (EF) and mitigation options for N2O emissions from oilseed rape cropping systems. We conducted a field experiment with three N levels (0, 171, and 217 kg/ha), where the N fertilizer was applied as ammonium sulfate nitrate with or without the nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP). N2O fluxes were measured using static chambers technique and soil samples were analyzed for water and mineral N content during a monitoring period of 368 days. The DMPP treatments showed a significantly increased level of ammonium (NH+ 4) for up to 18 weeks after spring fertilization as compared to the treatments without DMPP. However, this difference did not result in a corresponding decrease in (NO- 3) soil content, and no differences in cumulative N2O emissions were found between any fertilized treatments with or without DMPP (mean, 1.26 kg N2O-N ha−1 year−1). More field experiments are needed to clarify whether DMPP-coated mineral fertilizers could mitigate N2O emissions under different weather conditions, for example, under conditions where fertilization events concurred with rainfall events increasing water-filled pore space to the assumed 60% threshold for denitrification. Emission factors for mineral N fertilizer were 0.28%–0.36% with a mean of 0.32% across the fertilized treatments. These data concur with recent European studies suggesting that the EF for mineral N fertilizers in oilseed rape cropping systems may typically be lower than the default IPCC value of 1%. Further studies are needed to consolidate an EF for oilseed rape under temperate conditions, which will be determining for the sustainability of Northern European oilseed rape cultivation for biodiesel. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Triacylglycerides are naturally abundant and renewable feedstock for biofuels and chemicals. In this report, these seemingly stable compounds are shown to be reactive toward a variety of sulfonamides under Lewis acid catalysis. In these reactions, alkyl C(sp3)–O bonds are cleaved and C–N bonds constructed, providing functionalized value-added products directly from renewables. Mechanistic and scope study demonstrate that the origin of the reactivity could be the synergy of Lewis acid catalysis and neighboring group participation by the 2- or 3-acyloxy or acylamido group with respect to the reactive site. Since poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), a widely available consumer polyester, also contains 1,2-diol diester group as the repeating unit in the main chain, this chemistry can also be applied to efficient depolymerization of PET. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - A correlation to estimate the fuel ignition delay of a diesel engine operating with blends of straight soybean oil and diesel oil is proposed. Ignition delay measurements were carried out on a dynamometer bench using a 14.7 kW/2200 rpm single-cylinder compression ignition engine fueled with blends of 0%, 50%, 80% and 100% v/v straight soybean oil in commercial diesel oil (S10). The injection and ignition angles were determined from the second derivative of the in-cylinder pressure curve. A correlation was developed expressing the ignition delay data as a function of the droplet Reynolds number, global fuel/air equivalence ratio, in-cylinder gas temperature, and volume fraction of soybean oil. The non-dimensional parameters are obtained from the dimensions of the injector nozzle, liquid fuel and in-cylinder gas properties to generalize the applicability to other vegetable oils and engine operating conditions. The coefficient of determination (R2) of the curve-fit was 0.8465 for a 95% confidence interval. Finally, a sensitivity analysis showed a significant influence of the in-cylinder gas temperature and volume fraction of soybean oil on the ignition delay. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Inspired by the announcement that liquid biofuel will be used nationally by 2020 in China, the autoignition of surrogates from hydrogenated biomass pyrolysis oil, namely, the C2-C4 diols, including ethanediol, 1,2-propanediol, and 1,2-butanediol has been studied using a modified CFR engine. From the oxidation process before critical compression ratio (CCR), it is observed that C2-C4 diols had similar oxidation reactivity as ethanol, indicating that C2-C4 diols had the potential for use as a supplement for ethanol. In addition, both of ethanol and C2-C4 diols did not display low temperature heat release. The ignition characteristics of C2-C4 diols suggest that diol/TPGME blends could be used, as TPGME has high ignition quality and could be generated from diols with a carbon selectivity as high as 75%. Based on this idea, diol/TPGME blends with volume ratio 20:80 were prepared and tested using the modified CFR engine. The blends showed strong low temperature oxidation behavior, even under a low intake temperature at 120 °C and a low compression ratio at 4, the low temperature heat release peak could still be found for the blends. Finally, the physical delay and chemical delay times were tested by a modified CID instrument between 540 and 640 °C, indicating that chemical process played a more important role on the combustion process than physical process, and the influence of temperature was more important for physical processes than chemical processes. © 2019

AB  - Microalgal biomass has been widely investigated as a source of renewable energy, but currently, some alternatives are not economically competitive. Thermochemical conversion of biomass is an alternative way to transform their organic compounds into liquid and gaseous fuels. The aim of this work is twofold; first, the pyrolytic process of the microalga Botryococcus braunii (BB) by thermogravimetric analysis, as well as the relevant reaction kinetic constants and related activation energies, is assessed. Secondly, a sensitivity analysis of the biomass gasification process with air using a thermochemical model was conducted to predict the composition of a syngas as a function of the biomass moisture content and the biomass/air ratio. The results showed that BB biomass is composed mainly of carbon (62.4 wt.%) with volatile solids of 84 wt.%, while the fixed carbon represents around 7 wt.%. Additionally, observed values for heating (27.86 MJ kg−1) and activation energy (~ 110 kJ mol−1) were different from other algal feedstocks due to the capacity of accumulation of liquid hydrocarbons of this. On the other side, the gasification process showed it was found that the moisture content in the biomass and biomass/air ratio variables are key parameters for reaction temperature and producer gas composition. Accordingly, with a suitable combination of these variables, it is possible to obtain a syngas composed of gaseous species with high energy content (CO, 18 vol.%; H2, 17 vol.%; and CH4, 2 vol.%.), which can be transformed through processes such as Fisher-Tropsch process into liquid biofuels such as kerosene or gasoline. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Di-n-butyl ether (DBE, C8H18O) has been proposed as a promising biofuel for diesel engines, but details of its low-temperature (LT) oxidation chemistry are not well understood. This paper reports new speciation data obtained in the temperature range of 400–1100 K at ϕ=1 and nearly-atmospheric pressure, using a plug flow reactor combined with electron ionization molecular-beam mass spectrometry (MBMS) and two different jet-stirred reactors coupled with either online gas chromatography or tunable synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization-MBMS. The experimental results confirm that DBE is very reactive and exhibits two negative-temperature coefficient (NTC) zones around 500–550 K and 650–750 K. Speciation data with about 40 C0-C8 species are presented, including about 20 LT species not reported previously. Among those, fuel-specific C8H16O2 cyclic ethers were quantified. Also, butanoic acid, which is present in highest amounts among the detected LT intermediates, and C8H14O3 diones, were found to peak already near 500 K, suggesting their importance in the LT chemistry of DBE. Signals of several highly oxygenated peroxides (e.g., C8H14O5 and C8H16O6) were detected, indicating third O2 addition steps. Respective reaction pathways are suggested and discussed based on these experimental results. To better understand the LT chemistry of DBE, the present data were compared to two recent DBE models (Cai et al., 2014; Thion et al., 2017). Significant discrepancies between the experimental data and both models were found for important LT intermediates, of which many were not included in the respective mechanisms. The results reported in the present study thus provide new opportunities for refining DBE kinetic models. © 2019 The Combustion Institute

AB  - The impending restrictions on the sulfur content and greenhouse gas emissions of marine fuels represent a challenge for the maritime shipping industry and an opportunity for alternative fuels that may have lower environmental impacts but are not currently economically competitive. This study developed an integrated screening model to compare the technological, economic, and environmental performance of 33 “drop-in” marine biofuel blendstock supply chains, considering nine agroforestry residues and three thermochemical technologies. The biofuel production was modeled for 500 tonne per day “first-of-a-kind” biorefineries to reflect near-term production. Supply chains were modeled for biofuel production in both Brazil and Sweden to explore the impact of regional differences on the biofuels’ break-even prices and their life cycle emissions of greenhouse gases, SO2, and NOX. This study indicates that in the immediate term, marine biofuels from lignocellulosic feedstocks may have a minimum fuel selling price three or more times higher than current fossil marine fuel prices. Biofuels made from agricultural residues saw a 40–100 kg/GJ decrease in life cycle GHG emissions, but forestry residue emissions depended highly on biogenic carbon dioxide accounting. SO2, and NOX emissions were dominated primarily by combustion, which for SO2 were estimated to be much lower than fossil fuels, due to the negligible sulfur content of the biomass. Overall, no single biofuel was a clear winner in terms of economic and environmental performance in the model, but space is opened for deeper research, as the new regulations come into effect. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The use of ethyl decanoate combined with conventional diesel or biodiesel could be economically attractive. Thermophysical properties of ethyl decanoate at high temperatures can be an essential guidance for the structural design and optimization of the fuel injection system in diesel engine. The measurements of the speed of sound and the thermal diffusivity of ethyl decanoate (EeC10: 0) were carried out by the light scattering method, which are along five isobaric lines from (0.1–10) MPa at the temperatures (300.71–562.07) K and (295.34–565.49) K, respectively. The expanded relative uncertainties (k = 2) of the measurement systems are estimated to be 1.2% for speed of sound and 2.4% for thermal diffusivity. The thermal conductivities of ethyl decanoate at pressures up to 10 MPa and in the temperature range (303–363) K are derived, which agree well with literature values finding an AAD of 0.81%. The pρT dependences of the thermal conductivity are analyzed based on the vibrational theory. The results obtained show that the higher density of biofuels leads to smaller distances between oscillating molecules, of which the collision probability and intermolecular energy transport are enhanced. The consistent behaviors of biofuels that higher density leads to higher conductivity, and the dependence of the thermal conductivity on density becomes smaller with temperature increase are verified. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Department of Energy “Co-Optimization of Fuels and Engines” initiative aims to simultaneously develop novel high-performance fuels with advanced engine designs to reduce petroleum consumption. To achieve commercialization, advanced engines running on alternative fuels still must meet emissions regulations. Warm three-way catalysts (TWC) are very effective at meeting the stringent emissions regulations on pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane organic gases (NMOG) and carbon monoxide (CO) from gasoline-fueled spark-ignition (SI) engines operating under stoichiometric conditions; thus, most SI engine emissions occur during cold-start, when the TWC has not yet achieved light-off. In the current study, the light-off behavior of novel high-performance fuel candidates has been investigated on a hydrothermally-aged commercial TWC using a synthetic engine-exhaust flow reactor system according to industry guidelines. Over 30 potential fuel components were examined in this study, including alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, ketones, esters, aromatic ethers, and non-oxygenated aromatic hydrocarbons. Short-chain acyclic oxygenates, including alcohols, ketones, and esters, tended to light off at relatively low temperatures, while alkenes, aromatics, and cyclic oxygenates tended to light off at relatively high temperatures. The light-off behavior of alkanes and alkenes depended strongly on their size and structure. In terms of the influence on CO light-off on the TWC, the fuels fell into two distinct categories: (i) non-inhibiting species including C2-C3 alcohols, alkanes, acyclic ketones, and esters; and (ii) inhibiting species including alkenes, aromatic hydrocarbons, cyclic oxygenates, and C4 alcohols. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The esterification of furfuryl alcohol with 1-butanol was successfully tested at low initial butanol/furfuryl alcohol molar ratio values (4 and 8) in the temperature range 80–110 °C over different ion-exchange resins. The polymerization reaction of furfuryl alcohol also occurs, being more affected by the initial 1-butanol to furfuryl alcohol molar ratio than temperature under the conditions tested. The accessibility to acid centers conditioned the activity of ion-exchange resins. While for gel-type resins this can be related to the specific volume of the swollen polymer, for macroreticular resins there is a compromise between permanent porosity (for stiff resins) and the existence of a very flexible gel-phase zone for low crosslinked macroreticular resins. The maximum yield to butyl levulinate obtained was 63% at 110 °C and a molar butanol/furfuryl alcohol ratio of 8 on the macroreticular resin Amberlyst 39. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is considered a feasible replacement for fossil fuels. Alcohols are alternative biofuels, while also playing a role as additives to improve certain properties of diesel and biodiesel. In this work, the thermal conductivity in the liquid phase of binary mixtures of methyl caprate, usually the significant biodiesel component with three higher alcohols (1-propanol, 1-butanol, and 1-pentanol), was measured, with the temperature ranging from 287 K to 358 K at atmospheric pressure. The total standard uncertainty of the experimental results was estimated at less than 2% and the repeatability was better than ±0.5%. In addition, three correlations for estimating the thermal conductivity of mixtures were fitted and improved, with the average absolute relative deviation of the three correlations less than 0.30%. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study investigated the isolation and characterization of three novel bacterial strains; Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Sphingobacterium multivorum, and Sinorhizobium, isolated form agriculture land. From three hundred strains of bacteria, the three isolates were identified for their superior diesel degradation ability by a series of bench-scale tests. The isolates were further investigated in bench tests for their ability to grow in different diesel fuel concentrations, temperature and pH; degrade diesel fuel in vitro; and for the identification of functional genes. Semi-pilot bioelectrokinetic tests were conducted in three electrokinetic cells. An innovative electrode configuration was adopted to stabilize the soil pH and water content during the test. The genes expressed in the diesel degradation process including Lipases enzymes Lip A, LipB, Alk-b2, rubA, P450, and 1698/2041 were detected in the three isolates. The results showed that the solar panel voltage output is in agreement with the trapezoid model. The temperatures in the cells were found to be 5–7 °C higher than the ambient temperature. The electrode configuration succeeded in stabilizing the soil pH and water content, preventing the development of a pH gradient, important progress for the survival of bacteria. The diesel degradation in the soil after bioelectrokinetic tests were 20–30%, compared to 10–12% in the controls. The study succeeded in developing environmentally friendly technology employing novel bacterial strains to degrade diesel fuel and utilizing solar panels to produce renewable energy for bioelectrokinetics during the winter season. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The various benefits of biofuels versus fossil fuels due to recent global challenges and issues are the best approach toward low-cost economic production of renewable energy. This study is trying to obtain economic catalysts with easy fabrication technology. The synthesized catalysts were obtained using calcium oxide/nanoclay catalysts by an initial ion-exchange reaction of calcium oxide and nanoclays (montmorillonite). These catalysts have been synthesized for the first time by being stirred for 5 h at a temperature of 80 °C, and the colloidal supernatant is obtained and kept in an ultrasonic bath for 20 min. The solution was filtered, washed several times, the residual mixture on filter paper was dried in the oven at 50 °C for few hours, and the powder was calcined for 8 h in a furnace at 600 °C. After identification and characterization, using XRD, BET, and SEM, the results approved the formation of a new nanostructure in synthesized catalysts, which were suitable to be used in biodiesel production from waste oils with high free fatty acids content. The results of this study indicate that the catalysts production process is not complicated, and methyl ester production rates in all biodiesel samples were more than 97% (97.1–98.8%). © 2019, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.

AB  - The effects of using butanol–gasoline-blended fuels on performance, fuel consumption, and emission characteristics of a four-cylinder spark-ignition engine were experimentally investigated. The butanol-blending fraction was varied from 10 to 50% by volume. The engine speeds were tested at 2250 and 4250 rpm, while the throttle positions were set at 30% and 70%. The engine performance, specific fuel consumption, and emission properties have been carried out and compared. The results show that, at high throttle position, the flame propagation speed of combustion process as using the butanol–gasoline blends decreases as increasing the butanol-blending fraction and this becomes more obvious with the increase of engine speed. The engine brake torque and power are improved, as the butanol-blending fraction is less than 30% at low open throttle position, while those are gradually decayed as increasing throttle opening level. A significant reduction is observed in specific fuel consumption, as the butanol-blending fraction is less than 30% for all the tests. The emissions of CO, HC, and CO2 in the case of using butanol–gasoline blends are much better than those in the case of using pure gasoline. However, NOx emission is worse than that of the pure gasoline for all the test blends. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - The present study investigated the effect of ferric iron on growth and lipid content of the green microalga Tetradesmus obliquus as a promising feedstock with favorable features for biodiesel production. The microalga was isolated from a freshwater body and cultured for 20 days in five types of modified BG11 medium with different concentrations (0, 10−4, 10−3, 10−2, 10−1 mmol L−1) of ferric iron. The algae grown in medium supplemented with 10−2 mmol L−1 ferric iron had the highest specific growth rate of 0.36 ± 0.04 day−1 and remained in the exponential growth phase over the next 6 days compared with those grown in medium without iron supplementation. The peak of lipid content (34.19 ± 1.93% dry weight, DW) and biomass productivity (459.20 ± 2.37 mg L−1 day−1) was obtained in the media supplemented with 10−2 and 10−1 mmol L−1 ferric iron, respectively. The highest proportion of saturated fatty acids and the lowest proportion of unsaturated fatty acids were also achieved by adding 10−1 mmol L−1 ferric iron to the growth medium. These findings may lead to a two-step process for lipid production from T. obliquus, in which biomass should be separated from the culture supplemented with 10−2 mmol L−1 ferric iron concentration to achieve the maximum algal biomass in the first step and then inoculated to the culture supplemented with 10−1 mmol L−1 ferric iron concentration to reach the highest lipid productivity in the second step, leading to optimization of lipid production from T. obliquus. Although the quality of biodiesel produced from T. obliquus met the specification of the European biodiesel standard (EN14214) in all media, ferric iron supplementation could be used to optimize the lipid characteristics of T. obliquus for biodiesel production. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The biofuels have great ecological advantages against the petroleum fuels, especially when they are obtained from residues with environmental pollution potential. So, the biodiesel was produced using oil from the fish processing residue collected in the Fishermen's Colony Z-3, Brazil, and the experiments were developed with two different methods for production of biofuels. The fish residue was thermally treated to extract the fatty material and the biodiesel was produced by the methods of heating, stirring, and heating and stirring assisted by ultrasonic waves. The best biodiesel was with heating and stirring method with yields of 92.37% and 97.95% with the reaction times of 30 and 60 min, respectively. The ultrasonic method provided the highest biodiesel yield at the sonication time of 2 min, at the frequency of 20 kHz. The biodiesel produced from the fish waste showed high concentrations of sodium, potassium and magnesium. Furthermore, the production of biodiesel from a potential residue that can contaminate the environment, such as fish residue, promotes a social and economic increment in a community like Fishermen's Colony Z-3. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The current series of experimental trial was conducted to evaluate reduction in CO, NOx and UBHC of synthetic biodiesel based on waste cooking oil at various concentrations of CeO2 nanoparticles and Ce0.5Co0.5 nano-composite oxide at full engine load. The comparative analysis indicated the significant reductions in gaseous emissions from burning of pure diesel, biodiesel and additives enriched biodiesel blends. The Ce0.5Co0.5 nano-composite oxide performance was comparatively better than CeO2 regarding the reduction of exhaust emissions resulted from the combustion of various biodiesel blends. When compared with B20 blend, the observed reduction in CO, NOx and UBHC were 18.27%, 6.57% and 23.46%, respectively by using CeO2 (100 ppm), whereas 24.18%, 13.96% and 40.74%, respectively when Ce0.5Co0.5 nano-composite oxide (100 ppm) was used as additive. Both the CeO2 and Ce0.5Co0.5 nano-composite oxide were characterized by SEM, XRD and XPS techniques. The CeO2 and Ce0.5Co0.5 nano-composite oxide may be considered as future additives in green renewable energy regime having potential to reduce CO, NOx and UBHC exhaust emissions associated with combustion of biodiesel and its blends. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In Turkey, the consumption of diesel oil is increasing both in transportation and in agricultural fields. In this study, the opportunities of the use of safflower oil, which grow originally in Turkey as a direct fuel in diesel engines, were researched to provide a new alternative for biofuel industry and to popularize the farming of oil crops. In this study, the kit design was completed first, and afterwards safflower oil was exposed to the process of neutralization and laundering, and then turned into standard fuel. For engine performance experiments, reference experiences were conducted by using diesel fuel by using safflower as a fuel in the engine with kit for 500 h; comparisons were made with regards to power, moment, diesel consumption, and exhaust emission. As a result, it was seen that when safflower was used as a fuel, there was a decrease in motor performance and emission, however specific fuel consumption increased. When safflower was used, there was not any residual on the engine that was found. The designed kit, which can be easily produced with national technology, did not cause any malfunction or negativity in the engine and it was successfully used. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The objective of the present work was to evaluate the effect of the addition of dichloromethane extract obtained from Ginger rhizomes (Zingiber officinale Roscoe)in biodiesel, as well as to compare the results obtained with the synthetic antioxidants BHT and TBHQ. The soybean methyl biodiesel (BMS)used was produced in our laboratory. The thermal behavior of the extract, synthetic antioxidants and biodiesel produced were evaluated using TG/DTG techniques. The additions of EDG and BHT and TBHQ were performed in increasing proportions relative to the mass of the extract: mass of the methyl biodiesel and the samples were stored under the same conditions and studied for storage time of up to ninety days using TG/DTG and method to evaluate the action of the addition of these antioxidants in inhibiting and/or retarding the oxidative stability of the biodiesel samples. After 90 days of storage, the BAN-4 sample had the highest initial decomposition temperature. Regarding the oxidative stability, the samples with EDG additions also presented values higher than the minimum regulated by the ANP, confirming the action of the antioxidants present in the EDG in the control of the oxidation reactions of BMS. © 2019

AB  - In this study, a simple and robust derivatisation-free method has been developed using a gas chromatograph (GC), which has been validated as a suitable analysis for free fatty acids (FFAs) of waste cooking oil (WCO). As biodiesel synthesis from high acid value WCO involves pre-treatment steps, a non-catalytic approach has been employed for biodiesel production. This work has focused on the esterification of FFAs of high acidity feedstock for fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) production. The effect of four independent controllable factors, i.e. methanol to oil (M:O) molar ratio, temperature, pressure and time on FFAs conversion has been investigated. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) via Central Composite Design (CCD) has been implemented for designing experimental runs and optimising the process variables for maximum FFAs conversion. Four quadratic regression models have been developed representing empirical relationship between reaction variables and responses. The adequacy of the predicted models has been checked by numerous statistical validation techniques including analysis of variance (ANOVA) at 95% confidence level. The developed optimum conditions have been reported at 25:1, 256 °C, 110 bar and 16.6 min for M:O molar ratio, temperature, pressure and time, respectively. The predicted optimal conditions have been validated experimentally with 0.22% relative error. © 2019

AB  - This work explores the use of advanced thermal technologies for the conversion of refuse derived fuel prepared from MSW into clean syngas suitable for catalytic transformation into light hydrocarbon products. In particular, the possibilities for the specific production of C1–C4 hydrocarbons utilising a good quality syngas produced by two-stage plasma assisted gasification method are investigated. A number of catalytic tests were prepared with modified chemistry to evaluate the preliminary component activities on real waste-derived syngas. C1–C4 paraffins formed in all cases as a main products, with different product distribution for different conditions examined (up to 95% bioSNG on hydrocarbon product for supported nickel, 40% bioLPG for Cu–Zn/ZSM-5 catalysts mix). CO2 was the main byproduct with outlet concentrations ranging from 10 to 50% in volume. When increasing H2:CO in the syngas by external addition of hydrogen, CO conversion increases, as well as paraffin selectivity and hydrocarbons yield. Projections on a 65 MW thermal input bioSNG plant show that if 40 MW of electrical output from renewable sources are used to power a PEM stack during high power availability, the production of bioSNG could be increased by more than 33%, with a simultaneous reduction in CO2 emissions of more than 43%. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

The induction period of rapeseed oil biodiesel with different content of TEPA was determined by Rancimat assay. The content of metal elements in the extracted aqueous solution, before and after the addition of TEPA was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The results show that the addition of TEPA chelates the free copper and iron ions in biodiesel and improves the oxidation stability of biodiesel. TEPA is a good antioxidant and chelating agent; however, its Fe3+ chelating ability is weak. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The main goal of this study is to investigate the effect of boiler design by smoke tube addition on combustion characteristics and emissions in a small scale pellet boiler. In this context, flame/smoke tube pellet-fuelled boilers with two different constructions were designed, manufactured and tested. In the design of the boilers, the first passes of gases without smoke tubes (Boiler-1)and with smoke tubes (Boiler-2)were considered. The effect of different gas passes of the boilers on flame temperature, flue gas temperature, thermal efficiency, and flue gas emissions of O2, CO, CO2 and NOx were investigated and results were compared with each other. The results showed that adding smoke tubes to the first pass of the boiler decreased the average flue gas temperatures from 87.6 °C to 76.9 °C. The thermal efficiency of the Boiler-2 geometry reached a value of 92.3% and was nearly 1.3% higher than the Boiler-1 geometry. CO emissions increased up to 205 ppm from 166 to 371 ppm by addition of smoke tubes to the first pass of the Boiler-1. It was observed that smoke tubes addition to the first pass of the boiler did not affect the NOx emissions significantly, which were about 45–47 ppm. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of sodium nitrate (NaNO3)limitation on cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803 growth in order to increase its lipid content. The results revealed that the nitrate limitation conditions increase the volumetric biomass productivity, reaching the maximum content at 0.75 g/L NaNO3 (0.043 g/L·day). The maximum chlorophyll a and b concentrations were 6.42 μg/mL (0.75 g/L NaNO3)and 0.63 μg/mL (1.25 g/L NaNO3), respectively for Synechocystis PCC 6803, cultured in week 9. Also, Synechocystis PCC 6803 exhibited a decrease of protein content and an increase of lipid content with the decrease of NaNO3 concentration. The obtained results suggested that a concentration of 0.75 g/L NaNO3 in the Synechocystis PCC 680 growth medium resulted in the highest lipid content (21.3%), making it a potential feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Oxygenated organic compounds derived from biomass (biofuel) are a promising alternative renewable energy resource. Alcohols are widely used as biofuels, but studies on bifunctional alcohols are still limited. This work investigates the unimolecular thermal degradation of 2-methoxyethanol (2ME) using DFT/BMK and ab initio (CBS-QB3 and G3) methods. Enthalpies of the formation of 2ME and its decomposition species have been calculated. Conventional transition state theory has been used to estimate the rate constant of the pyrolysis of 2ME over a temperature range of 298–2000 K. Production of methoxyethene via 1,3-H atom transfer represents the most kinetically favored path in the course of 2ME pyrolysis at room temperature and requires less energy than the weakest C α − C β simple bond fission. Thermodynamically, the most preferred channel is methane and glycoladhyde formation. A ninefold frequency factor gives a superiority of the C α − C β bond breaking over the C γ − O β bond fission despite comparable activation energies of these two processes. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Conventional fuels used for supplying internal combustion piston engines include petrols and diesel oils produced from petroleum. These are a non-renewable energy source. The environmental policy of the European Union is geared towards increasing the share of renewable fuels in the overall energy consumption. An alternative fuel originating from a renewable source, which could be used for feeding self-ignition internal combustion engines are the fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) of plant oils. The paper reports selected results of testing a 1.3 MULTIJET SDE 90 PS self-ignition engine with the Common Rail reservoir feed system supplied with mixtures of diesel oil and rape oil fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). Tests were carried out on an engine test bed equipped with an eddy-current brake. The purpose of the tests was to determine the economic–energy and ecological indices of engine operation. The concentrations of exhaust gas gaseous components were measured using a MEXA-1600DEGR analyzer, while the particulate concentrations, with a MEXA-1230PM analyzer. In addition, the variations of working medium pressures in the engine chamber and of fuel pressure upstream the injector were recorded as a function of crankshaft rotation angle using the AVL IndiSmart 612 indication system for this purpose. The physicochemical properties of fuels used in the tests were determined using a fuel analyzer. The obtained testing results made it possible to determine and assess the operation indices of the engine fed with mixtures of diesel oil and rape oil fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) with slightly higher ester contents than the requirements of the currently applicable diesel oil standard. © 2018 Energy Institute

AB  - Albania has historically been known to have an active but challenging drilling activity that demands the most innovative technology to develop, predominantly, medium-heavy oil reservoirs. Although recent efforts have been made by the government to stimulate and expand the largest onshore European oilfield, technical and economical obstacles are prevalent. These obstacles make it difficult to fully develop reliable and profitable hydrocarbon bearing zones in a downturn economy, especially since Albanian oil can be costly to produce and refine. Due to these typical issues that affect many local energy sectors, many developed countries diversify their energy production to avoid strict dependency on crude oil. An emblematic and modern option that is extensively gaining popularity in Europe focuses on renewable energy from sophisticated recycling programs. Although Albania is a relatively “green” country when it pertains to its electricity production (97% hydropower and 3% fossil fuels), it has yet to develop energy-recycling programs that it can salvage for self-sustainable energy sources. The past years have seen a conscious revitalization and stimulation in the mentality of green economy in Albania. But, in comparison to the rest of “western Europe” that are leading world examples in efficient recycling, it is significantly lagging with initial strides just now focusing on aligning national legislations with current EU models. Furthermore, two crucial reasons that should motivate Albania to investigate new applications for energy recycling are: (1) alternatives to crude oil and petroleum products that can be supplemental and provide stable access to fossil fuels; (2) industrial and municipal recycling via waste management to reprocess waste and produce industrial raw material-spawning the emergence of a “circular economy” to develop the backbone needed to strengthen the industrial and manufacturing markets for a self-sustaining economy. Accordingly, in this paper, the topic that will be addressed, given the recent decrease in oil & gas prices, focuses on the Albanian energy sector’s capability to sustain and develop a supplementary recycling program via “waste-to-fuel” (WTF) technology (biofuels and/or inorganic waste). With the intent that it could function cooperatively with Albania’s active drilling program to mitigate dependency on a single fuel source and produce enough fossil fuel in an effective and sustainable manner. © 2018, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, Part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Co-pyrolysis of grape seeds and polystyrene was conducted in a fixed-bed reactor, followed by an analysis of the organic phase for possible further application as a drop-in fuel. Significant positive synergistic effects were found with the addition of polystyrene (5–40 wt%) to the conventional pyrolysis of grape seeds. There was a considerable improvement in the organic phase yield, in particular, reaching values over 80 wt%, markedly higher than those obtained from conventional pyrolysis (61 wt%). Fuel properties of the bio-oil were also upgraded, with a decrease in oxygen content and an increase in the heating value. An organic bio-oil fraction with pH values ranging from 5.4 to 6.2 was obtained, reducing the issues associated with handling bio-oils obtained from common pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass, usually ranging pH between 2 and 3. Finally, an increment in the desired compounds, mainly aromatics, was also attained, while at the same time achieving a low content of undesired compounds, such as phenols. It was demonstrated that polystyrene can act as a H2-donor, favoring oligomerization, cyclation and hydrodeoxygenation reactions into aromatic compounds. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The energy sector has grown significantly over the years, causing an increase in carbon emission that has led to serious global warming problems. Consequently, electric vehicles (EVs) have become a favourable solution in the transportation sector due to their green technology attributes. This paper aims to apply the Carbon Emission Pinch Analysis (CEPA) method to the transportation sector in Iskandar Malaysia. The modified CEPA method is applied by constructing a composite curve for transportation modes and the total carbon emission was plotted in order to study the minimum electricity requirement that needs to be generated to implement the use of EVs. Road and rail transportation were considered in the transport composite curve based on the current policies available and to achieve the new carbon emission target by the year 2025. The alternatives available to reduce carbon emission in Iskandar Malaysia include increasing public transport modal share; fuel switching from petrol and diesel to natural gas and biofuels; and increasing transport efficiency via plug-in hybrid and EVs. Four scenarios were established and evaluated based on economic and environmental aspects. As a result, Scenario 4 which considered all policies available (transport management, fuel switching and fuel efficiency) have showed the most promising fuel mix for future transportation demands. An estimated total amount of 0.25 TJ of electricity is needed for EV implementation with a total estimated cost of RM 1.3 billion. The total carbon emission for this scenario is 1101.96 kt-CO2. This research can benefit the Government, town planners, or policy makers, for preliminary energy planning. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - More than 8.5 million people live in Tehran, the capital of Iran, with 111 pollutant days during 2016. Based on Iranian 2016 energy balance sheet, more than 76% of SPM was emitted by gas oil combustion. To determine the main pollutant fuel-consuming sector, the amount of gas oil consumption and SPM production are investigated. Therefore, the transportation and power plant sectors are determined as the main gas oil users with 51.1% and 30.5% of its total consumption. Next, the reduced external cost of implementing biodiesel instead of gas oil for mobile and fixed sources is deliberated. Finally, by comparing the external cost of gas oil consumption and Iran's gross domestic production in 2016, it is revealed that by replacing gas oil with biofuels, 3.935 billion dollars (0.95% of gross domestic production of Iran in 2016) can be reduced. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The OH radical plays an important role in combustion, and isopentanol (3-methylbutan-1-ol) is a promising sustainable fuel additive and second-generation biofuel. The abstractions of H atoms from fuel molecules are key initiation steps for chain branching in combustion chemistry. In comparison with the more frequently studied ethanol, isopentanol has a longer carbon chain that allows a greater number of products, and experimental work is unavailable for the branching fractions to the various products. However, the site-dependent kinetics of isopentanol with OH radicals are usually experimentally unavailable. Alcohol oxidation by OH is also important in the atmosphere, and in the present study we calculate the rate constants and branching fractions of the hydrogen abstraction reaction of isopentanol by OH radical in a broad temperature range of 298-2400 K, covering temperatures important for atmospheric chemistry and those important for combustion. The calculations are done by multipath variational transition state theory (MP-VTST). With a combination of electronic structure calculations, we determine previously missing thermochemical data. With MP-VTST, a multidimensional tunneling approximation, multiple-structure anharmonicity, and torsional potential anharmonicity, we carried out more realistic rate constant calculations than can be computed by conventional single-structure harmonic transition state theory or by the empirical relations that are currently used in atmospheric and combustion modeling. The roles of various factors in determining the rates are elucidated, and we show that recrossing, tunneling, and multiple structures are all essential for accurate work. We conclude that the multiple structure anharmonicity is the most important correction to conventional transition state theory for this reaction, although recrossing effects and tunneling are by no means insignificant and the tunneling depends significantly on the path. The thermodynamic and kinetics data determined in this work are indispensable for the gas-phase degradation of alcohols in the atmosphere and for the detailed understanding and prediction of ignition mechanisms of biofuels in combustion. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The transport sector is the most essential driver of growth and economic development, which is one of the biggest contributors to climate change, responsible for almost a quarter of the global carbon dioxide emissions. In this paper, the experiments were conducted for an injection timing of 21° with standard injection pressure of 220 bar at different proportions such as 20%, 40% and 60% of biodiesel blends with pure diesel fuel. Other parameters like injection pressure and mass flow rate are kept constant. The performance parameters for running the engine are 1500 rpm and a rated power of 4.4 kW. The performance test resulted in the increased BTE and reduction in the SFEC for B20 blend as compared to the other proportions. The emission characteristics show that the CO, UHC and NOx were decreased for B20 when compared with the other proportions. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Recently, use of biodiesel as a diesel substitute has increased significantly. Currently, the biodiesel value added to diesel in Brazil is 10%. To maintain biodiesel quality during storage, antioxidants must be added. The most commonly used antioxidants are synthetic compounds. Due to the diversity of low cost agro-industrial waste with antioxidant activity, including cereal and fruit derivatives, several research studies reported the use of these waste materials as antioxidants. Barley waste (RCV) contains α-tocopherol (vitamin E), which acts as an antioxidant. Thus, this paper aims to investigate the use of RCV and citric acid as antioxidants in biodiesel. The conditions were optimized for the extraction and application of RCV in biodiesel (methyl ester soybean oil) using a 3² factorial design. RCV extracts were added during biodiesel production, which eliminates steps and improves the process. The antioxidant activity was evaluated using an accelerated oxidation method. Addition of RCV (11 g L–1) led to an induction time of 5.76 ± 0.11 h. However, addition of a blend of natural antioxidants [RCV (11 g L–1) and citric acid (0.1% w/v)] led to an increased induction time of 14.67 ± 2.10 h, which was attributed to the synergistic effect of the antioxidants. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill) is an important source of oil for biodiesel production in Brazil. However, the traits related to oil content and fatty acid profile are not targeted by soybean breeding programs. Developing methods to increase oleic and reduce linolenic fatty acid content within soybean genotypes will increase the use of soybeans for food and feed, as well as biodiesel production. Biodiesel produced with high polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) content has a high tendency to undergo oxidation, making storage difficult and overall quality reduced. On the other hand, oils with high levels of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) are preferred for biodiesel production because oxidation is not increased, improve cold flow properties significantly and nitrogen oxide emissions are decreased. In addition, soybean oil with high concentration of PUFAs causes low oxidative stability, resulting in rancidity, a rapid decline of optimal flavor and reducing storage time of manufactured food products. 242 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were evaluated in six locations in Brazil for grain yield, oil content, oil production, and fatty acid composition. A multi-trait index based on factor analysis and ideotype-design (FAI-BLUP index) was applied to identify genotypes best related with the ideotype for biodiesel production. This method is based on mixed models, with genotype and environment effects being considered as random and fixed, respectively. In addition, the best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) method was used to predict the genetic values. Six RILs outperformed both parents and can be selected as genotypes more suitable for biodiesel production. Genetic selection reduced linolenic fatty acid content by 14%. Results indicated the presence of genetic variability for fatty acid composition. The significant increases in oleic and reductions in linolenic contents may be easily achieved with the introduction of mutant FAD2-1A and FAD2-1B genes through breeding programs or biotechnological strategies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Microbial oil has been a valuable alternative oil source with applications in the food, cosmetics and biofuels sectors. As concerns for the environment grow, microbially-synthesized oil has emerged as a potential contributor for sustainable production of biodiesel. However, the high costs of its production hinder its large-scale application. Main bottleneck to industrial lipid production is the cost of the fermentation stage. Therefore, it is imperative to design cultivations with little operating requirements and high yields, adjusted to an oleaginous system. This paper provides an overview of the latest advances in oleaginous yeast cultivation in bioreactors. Focus is given to oleaginous yeasts and de novo lipid accumulation due to their high lipid accumulating ability, robustness and versatility across a range of substrates. The advantages and disadvantages of different cultivation modes, feeding patterns and impact on biomass and lipid yield are critically reviewed. The role of biochemical engineering in facilitating understanding of the lipid accumulation kinetics, lipid productivity and its importance as predictive scale up tool is highlighted through a review of existing equations. Perspectives for further bioprocess improvement through kinetic modelling, and valorisation through utilisation of by-products are also discussed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Gasoline compression ignition (GCI) engines have received more and more attention owing to their high thermal efficiency and low harmful emissions. However, GCI engines fueled by pure gasoline with low reactivity are limited to poor combustion stability at low loads and high pressure rise rate at high loads. To this end, a kind of second-generation hydrogenated catalytic biodiesel (HCB) from waste cooking oil with high reactivity is blended into the China 95#gasoline with different volume ratios, and the effect of blended ratio on the combustion and emission characteristics of a heavy-duty diesel engine was explored in the present study. The results indicate that ignition performance is significantly improved as the increase in HCB proportion, maximum combustion pressure can be effectively suppressed, and the combustion stability under low load conditions is much enhanced. Furthermore, HCB blended ratio should match combustion phasing controlled by the start of injection (SOI) to obtain better engine performance and wider operation range. In terms of emissions, the gas emissions of nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and unburned hydrocarbon can be significantly reduced with increasing HCB fraction, however, the particulate matter emissions are increased slightly as a penalty. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, a 3-dimensional numerical platform coupled with skeletal chemical reaction mechanism is employed to investigate the impact of various operating conditions on the performance and emissions of a RCCI engine fueled with biodiesel and methanol. Especially, a φ-T map was employed to investigate the methanol percentage on the performance of the engine. The results indicated that the groups of cells distributed at high ER (above 2.0) decrease as methanol percentage increases. When the engine is operating at full load conditions, compared to pure biodiesel, the IMEP of the RCCI engine with 60% methanol increases by 10.2%, soot emissions significantly drops by 75%, but the NOx emissions increases by 12.3%. This is because the increase of methanol percentage creates a better mixing between the fuel and air and resulting in a faster and more homogeneous combustion process. However, when the engine is operating at 10% load conditions, with the increase of methanol percentage, the combustion will be deteriorated. For extreme case, when methanol percentage increases to 80%, misfire takes place in the engine due to its significant higher latent heat and specific heat of the methanol. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative diesel fuel, and it is derived from vegetable oils or animal fats via transesterification process. The free fatty acid content of the oils is the main deciding factor to select either one or two steps transesterification process. The processing cost of biodiesel production depends upon the biodiesel production method. Generally, oil is extracted from biodiesel feedstock, and further, it is analyzed for its suitability for biodiesel production. In order to assess the suitability of groundnut seeds with different viability for biodiesel production, the experiment was conducted. Also, the relationship between seed viability and its oil's properties were studied. Eleven groundnut seed lots were tested for their seed viability as well as the fuel properties of the oil, after extraction. The result indicate that as the seeds lose its viability, the activity of antioxidant enzyme decreases leading to an alteration in free fatty acid, saponification value, iodine value, and cetane number. Correlation analysis between seed viability of seed and free fatty acid of groundnut oil indicates an inverse and strong relationship with oil's fuel properties. The groundnut seed lots with more than 60 percent germination were found to possess oil with excellent fuel properties. It was also found that the above seed lot can be suited for alkali based single-step transesterification process due to lower free fatty acid (< 1.8%). Seeds with high viability had less oil oxidation potential due to the higher activity of antioxidant enzymes. Furthermore, the quick viability assessment test kit can be used to quickly assess the suitability of oilseeds for biodiesel production, at any point of seed stock storage. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The objective of the present work was to study the oxidative stability (OS) estimated from the induction period (IP) and the cold filter plugging point (CFPP) of blends made with different proportions of soybean methyl biodiesel (BOS) and bovine tallow methyl biodiesel (BSB). BOS is poorly resistant to oxidation because its composition is predominantly unsaturated esters, but it has a satisfactory cold filter plugging point. The BSB is composed of saturated esters and of the lower carbon chain and thus has good oxidation stability values, but has poor CFPP values. Thus, BOS / BSB mixtures in different proportions were made to evaluate the ideal amount of the mixture in which it was possible to obtain IP and CFPP properties in satisfactory values by the legislation. The mixtures started at 10% BSB and 90% BOS and was increased 5% up to the 50% percentage of each biodiesel in each blend. Samples with 45% and 50% BSB had oxidative stability above the minimum required by law, and all blends had the CFPP value within the legal values. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study an exhaust gas recirculation system was developed for a small single cylinder 4-stroke engine. Then the mathematical models to correlate responses as the engine emissions and performance characteristics to the factors, include engine load, engine speed, EGR rate and biodiesel fuel percent, were developed. Finally, by using the developed models and NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II) method, the factors were optimized. The highest decrease in NOx emissions while using the biodiesel and EGR is 63.76% with B10 fuel blend (10% biodiesel fuel and 90% diesel fuel blend by volume) and 30% EGR rate. The highest reduction in HC emission levels while using EGR and biodiesel simultaneously, has been 54.05%. The adjusted R2 of the proposed model for the CO, HC, NOx, Power, BSFC and smoke were 0.94, 0.91, 0.88, 0.95, 0.89 and 0.94, respectively. Results of the optimization of the engine factors with NSGA-II method has been satisfactory and the pareto front for different test conditions was proposed. The outcomes of the study revealed that the optimization should be taken into account in the development of the new policy for using of the biofuel in the internal combustion engines. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The hybrid power system (HPS) that integrates diesel/biodiesel plant with renewable energy (RE) technologies has become increasingly popular to alleviate greenhouse gases emissions issue of the sole diesel/biodiesel power system. Integrated diesel-RE power system offers cleaner power supply while minimising cost of diesel fuel and diesel system maintenance. The use of Power Pinch Analysis (PoPA) method for the integration of diesel plants and RE systems into HPS with the objective to minimise fuel requirement and operational time of diesel generator has been presented. This work aims to achieve the same objective via probability theory utilisation, to simplify the PoPA procedure involving the matching of various routes for power flows. The extended technique called the Probability-Power Pinch Analysis (P-PoPA) can give accurate results as those established from the PoPA method within a shorter analysis time because it replaces the tedious manual matching step with correction factors. All probable routes of power from RE and diesel generators to demands are considered in computing the correction factors, in order to target the minimum diesel power in the integrated system. The result of a Case Study demonstrates that 19% saving in diesel fuel consumption can be realised if the present diesel station is supported with renewable solar power in an HPS. The result of the P-PoPA method is accurate with a very minor deviation to that from the conventional PoPA technique. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Acid pre-impregnated steam explosion (APSE) pretreatment was employed to hydrolyze hemicellulose to produce butanol. The cellulose and lignin remaining in the solid were utilized to produce boxboard. The optimal conditions were consisted of pre-impregnation at a concentration of 2% sulfuric acid for 30 min, steam explosion pressure of 1.6 MPa, and residence time for 5 min. Under these conditions, the handsheet with the weight of 80 g m−2 was produced by corn straw explosion pulping, the burst index was 0.99 kPa m2 g-1, the tensile index was 24 N m g-1, the ring crush index was 0.58 N m g-1, the breaking length was 2469 m, which were close to the strength indexes of waste corrugated pulp. The steam explosion hydrolysate was fermented by Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824. The percentage of monosaccharides consumed reached 93.2%, and the yield of ABE was 0.31 g/g sugar (acetone: 0.09 g/g, butanol: 0.18 g/g, ethanol: 0.04 g/g). The bio-refining of corn straw to produce butanol and pulp is a kind of utilization method with industrialization potential, which can realize the high-value comprehensive utilization of straw. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the present study, three different solvents – ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran and petroleum ether – were used to extract bio-crude from a hydrothermal liquefaction product mixture obtained from canola meal and waste wheat flour. The bio-crude yields and the ease of extraction were compared for each of the solvents to evaluate the efficacy of the solvent-extraction process and to determine the most suitable solvent for the same. Among the three solvents, ethyl acetate was identified as the most favourable option for solvent-extraction. The extraction carried out using ethyl acetate yielded significantly large amounts (bio-crude yield: 31.8 wt%) of an easy-to-handle, high quality bio-crude that is most suitable for further upgrading processes and eventual bio-diesel applications. The bio-crude extracted using ethyl acetate had a higher heating value of 46.0 MJ/kg, an oxygen content of 9.2 wt% and an ash content of 0.1 wt%. The aforementioned bio-crude exhibited the highest oxidation stability at room temperature with an induction period of 86.5 days and had a significant percentage of its compounds in the C13-C24 carbon range. The amounts of nitrogen and sulphur were quite low in all the bio-crude samples. Silica polymorphs such as quartz and α-cristobalite, along with calcium mica, were the dominant phases in all the bio-residue samples. The bio-residue obtained using ethyl acetate had the highest specific surface area (249 m2/g) among the three bio-residue samples with an average pore volume of 0.37 cm3/g and an average pore size of 7 nm. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Marine macroalgae or seaweeds are increasingly becoming strong candidates for sustainable biofuel feedstocks of the future. This study features a large-scale process design and comprehensive analysis of an industrial-scale (400,000 tons dry feedstock per year) poly-generation pyrolysis process that utilizes 3rd generation biofuel feedstock, Saccharina japonica brown seaweed, and produces diesel-range hydrocarbon fuel, heat, and power. Process design relied predominately on published experimental data regarding fast pyrolysis of S. japonica in a fixed-bed reactor system, followed by dewatering and catalytic upgrading of the produced biocrude. The design featured acid wash pretreatment for the reduction of mineral content, and subsequently a Rankine power cycle utilizing biochar. The design also considered two distinct cases of on-site hydrogen production and hydrogen purchase. Based on the experimental data, a rigorous steady-state flowsheet model was constructed using Aspen Plus for each design case. The results of comprehensive techno-economic assessment, sensitivity, and Monte Carlo analyses provided insight into capital cost for the process, minimum product selling price, and selling price ranges. Finally, the process is compared with traditional crude oil extraction and processing in terms of significant reductions in CO2 emissions, hence providing strong evidence of its environmental sustainability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study aims to harvest the hazardous algae from water using biologically synthetized magnetic nanomaterials with cheap, simple and environmentally friendly process to valorise it into biodiesel. The characteristics of obtained nanoparticles showed that it has 50 nm-sized hexagonal or round-shaped nanoparticles indicating its high adsorption capability due to its large surface area (78.4 m2 g−1) and suitable porous volume (0.3 cm3 g−1), and thus, proved to be effective to collect microalgae from water. The optimum conditions for harvesting efficiency (HE) were determined under a response surface methodology (RSM) using CCD approach (five-level, four-factor Central Composite Design) including various parameters; particle dosage, time, stirring speed and temperature while considering the HE (%) as the response. The optimized conditions for HE were found to be 56 mg L−1 particle dosage, 48 s, 310 rpm and 22.5 °C. The optimized algae HE was 82.4%. The lipid content of the harvested biomass was 5.6%. The produced oil was found to have high saturation level in which butyric (C4:0) (43.4%), heneicosanoic (C21:0) (22.4%), heptadecanoic (C17:0) (16.7%) and undecanoic (C11:0) (12.8%) acids were found as the dominant fatty acids. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) composition of obtained biodiesel was suitable comprising of 40.46% saturated fatty acids, 42.77% monounsaturated fatty acids and 16.77% polyunsaturated fatty acids. The physicochemical properties of the produced biodiesel were characterized. All properties, except acid value, satisfy international ASTM D6751 criteria and can be used commercially with acid neutralization. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study analyzed the dynamic changes in metabolites and key proteins during the seed development of Pongamia pinnata L. (Family: Fabaceae) with a particular focus on lipid biosynthesis and oil accumulation. The developing seeds were collected at four different stages: 120 (stage 1), 180 (stage 2), 240 (stage 3) and 300 (stage 4) days after flowering (DAF), representing S1, S2, S3 and S4 respectively. The analysis of seed pigments and mRNA expression patterns of key photosynthetic genes confirmed the photo-autotrophic behavior of P. pinnata seed during the initial stages of development. The metabolite profiling of developing P. pinnata seeds also revealed differentially expressed sugars, amino acids, free fatty acids and organic acids. Proteins related to development, energy metabolism, lipid accumulation as well as stress responses were documented through MALDI-TOF-MS/MS analysis. The structure and pattern of oil body accumulation at each stage of seed development were determined by electron and confocal microscopy of the cotyledonary sections. The thin layer chromatogram of P. pinnata oil revealed higher amount of Triacylglycerides and the fatty acid profile of extracted triacylglycerides showed a rapid increase in oleic acid (C18:1) at S3 and S4. The outcomes reveal new insights into the complex oleogenic metabolism during P. pinnata seed development at macro level. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this research, Portulaca seed oil was studied as a feedstock for biodiesel production. Portulaca is a type of weed that is able to grow in most weather conditions. The process of transesterification reaction for biodiesel production was optimized using the response surface methodology (RSM) method. Moreover, quadratic polynomial equations were obtained for the transesterification reaction. The ultrasonic system was employed to reduce the reaction time. The effects of independent variables such as catalyst concentration, reaction time and molar ratio of methanol-to-oil were studied. The reaction temperature was considered to be 55 °C. Also, the amplitude and the pulse of the ultrasonic system were 70% and 0.4 s, respectively. The results of the research indicated that all independent variables and their interaction have a significant effect on biodiesel yield. The highest biodiesel yield was 97.81% for the following optimum conditions: catalyst concentration of 1.01% (w/w), methanol: oil molar ratio of 8.49:1, reaction time of 8.01 min, temperature of 55 °C, pulse of 0.4 s, and an amplitude of 70%. Furthermore, all the measured physicochemical properties are in accordance with the ASTM standard. According to the obtained results, it can be concluded that Portulaca weed seeds are a suitable source for biodiesel production. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Refined palm kernel oil was trans-esterified with ethanol to produce fatty acid ethyl esters. The medium-chain fatty acid ethyl ester (bio-kerosene) was fractionated from the bottom fraction and was characterized for its properties as well as lubricity. The heat of combustion was reported at 38.32 MJ/kg which was 11.09% lower than fossil kerosene. Combustion testing in a small-scale gas-turbine jet engine was investigated without engine modification. The optimum thrust-specific fuel consumption was reported for 0.99 L/kJ at 102,200 rpm. The exhaust gas characteristic was superior to fossil kerosene due to lower emission of CO, hydrocarbon, and NO2. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Palm oil is the most abundant plant oil resource in the world. Through fuel reforming, properties of diesel, palm oil, and gasoline blend fuels are superior to those of diesel. With the constraint of major properties, D56Z24G20 (56% D100, 24% palm oil, and 20% gasoline by vol.) and D42Z18G40 (42% D100, 18% palm oil, and 40% gasoline by vol.) are prepared for experimental investigation and comparison with D100 (100% diesel). The combustion and emission results indicate that D56Z24G20 and D42Z18G40 release heat more concentratedly than D100 and thereby have a higher peak combustion temperature (PCT). NOx emission of D56Z24G20 and D42Z18G40 are higher than that of D100. Particle number concentrations (PNC) of D56Z24G20 and D42Z18G40 are higher than that of D100 at low and partial loads and a little lower at medium and high loads. The high PNC of D56Z24G20 and D42Z18G40 particles is mainly attributed to the high PNC of nucleation mode particles and this phenomenon can be eliminated with a 20% ratio of exhaust gas recirculation. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Many possibilities have been explored so far for replacing petro-diesel with biodiesel and hybrid fuel, but none of these bio-fuels could completely substitute the petro-diesel with or without modification in the CI engine. In this perspective, renewable diesel or green diesel has been gaining popularity due to its higher cetane index and calorific value than that of petro-diesel, biodiesel, and hybrid fuel. This study investigates the production of green diesel from waste cooking oil (WCO) by hydro-processing and TBP distillation. The fuel properties of the green diesel thus produced were estimated using ASTM/EN standards and thereafter green diesel (G100) and its blends (G10, G20, G30 &amp; G50) were used as fuel in a CI engine to analyze the effect on engine combustion, performance and emission characteristics. The results obtained were compared with petro-diesel, optimized biodiesel blend B30 and hybrid fuel (HB-1) to explore its efficacy under same experimental test rig and operating conditions. Over the entire loading conditions, green diesel blends showed higher BTE with lower BSEC. The emissions of CO, UHC and smoke opacity reduced, but a slight increase in NOX level was observed. The shorter ignition delay and higher cetane index of green diesel generated peaks of CP, HRR and ROPR near TDC as compared to the other tested fuels.

AB  - A novel approach for sustainability enhancement of jet biofuel production from palm oil and soybean oil is proposed. A comparative Well-to-Wake analysis was performed assuming a supply chain in two strategic regions of Brazil, according to each raw material. The functional unit was 1.0 MJ of energy, and impacts were quantified using Impact 2002 + and Cumulative Energy Demand methods. Two different situations, referred to as scenarios, for each vegetable oil were proposed. First conversion scenario (baseline case) included conventional jet biofuel production characteristics, regarding the use of fossil hydrogen. Second conversion scenario (enhanced case) explored renewable alternatives for hydrogen production, such as residual biomass gasification, in palm oil case, and water electrolysis, for soybean oil scenario. Results indicate significant reductions, ranging from 57% to 94%, in the global warming impact category of all scenarios as compared with conventional jet fuel. Moreover, palm oil and soybean oil improved scenarios reached the lowest carbon footprint of 4.8 and 33.9 g CO2 eq/MJ, respectively. Additionally, when considering Life Cycle Energy Efficiency an increase of about 65% and 63% for palm oil and soybean oil enhanced scenarios was observed, compared to baseline cases. In the case of Fossil Energy Ratio, an increase of 4.4% and 29.6% was determined in the same vein. Besides, in all scenarios, palm oil showed lower consumption of fossil and renewable energy than soybean oil. Some limitations of the present work can be described as: economic and logistic feasibility, due to immature technologies; geographic conditions which could affect agricultural performance; and technical aspects regarding hydrogen production technologies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuel production can have an adverse environmental impact, mainly in the crop production stage. This study compared the impact of camelina and crambe cultivation under conventional and reduced tillage management using a life cycle assessment (LCA). The study presents the impact of these non-edible crops for various purposes. The LCA was determined by the IPCC 2007 and ReCiPe Endpoint methods and the emission of greenhouse gases for both crops per hectare was similar (1,732–1,772 kg ha−1 CO2 eq.), although when calculated per 1 Mg of dry seeds, this value was more variable (1,152–1,528 kg Mg−1 CO2 eq.). When converted to the oil content, it was 3,368–3,999 kg Mg−1 CO2 eq., whereas when calculated for energy content it was 23.74–27.15 kg GJ−1 CO2 eq. The highest normalised score for all crops and cultivation technologies was determined for fossil depletion, followed by climate change and particulate matter formation, which resulted in a high level of damage in the human health category. The study found that reduced tillage results in lower environmental impact compared with traditional tillage due to lower consumption of production means, although the results do not account for soil carbon change, which should be considered in further detailed analysis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - According to the high sugar and oil content of algae, the algal biofuel have been taken into consideration in recent years. This paper develops a multi-objective mixed integer quadratic programming (MMIQP) model to optimize the design and planning of an algae-based biofuel supply chain network under environmental and economic objectives. The goals of this paper are set to maximize the total profit and carbon dioxide absorption of the supply chain. The proposed mathematical model considers the deterioration issue in the inventory and during the transportation, in a multi-period time horizon. Since the alternative fuel price is not certain in the real world, a two-stage stochastic programming is utilized to address this uncertainty. Moreover, data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach is proposed to rank the candidate cities based on efficiency for microalgal harvesting. The applicability and efficiency of the proposed model are finally demonstrated through a real case study in Iran. © 2019

AB  - Synthesizing high performance jet fuel from biomass provides potential way to convert low-cost biomass to valuable fuels and meets the requirements of sustainable development. Here, we report a one-pot synthesis of high density and low freezing point jet-fuel-ranged blending from bio-derived phenol and cyclopentanol, which is with high yield, simple and low-cost for scale-up. With the co-presence of acid catalyst like Hβ and metal catlayst like Pd/C, the alkylation first happens to produce bi-and tri-cyclic compounds under N2 atomphere, then in H2 atmosphere the remained reactant is partly hydrogenated and takes part in alkylation again to produce cyclic compounds, finally hydrodeoxygenation happens to convert all the compounds to cyclic hydrocarbons. A jet-fuel-blending containing bi- and tri-cyclic alkanes is obtained at high molar yield of 83.9% from the starting reactant, which shows high density of 0.89 g/mL, freezing point lower than −75 °C. Especially, the major component, i.e. cyclopentylcyclohexane shows much better low-temperature properties compared with reported hydrocarbons with similar molecular structure. This result provides a simple, low-cost way to synthesize high performance jet fuel from biomass. © 2019

AB  - This paper describes the application of an artificial neural network, genetic algorithm and analytic network process-technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution for the selection of the optimum fuel blend. A single-cylinder, constant-speed direct-injection diesel engine with a rated output of 4.4 kW was used for exploratory analysis at different load conditions. Ten objectives–brake thermal efficiency, maximum rate of pressure rise, NOx, CO2, CO, HC, smoke, exhaust gas temperature, ignition delay and combustion delay were considered. The proposed ANN model is integrated with GA and the hybrid multi-criteria decision-making technique of ANP-TOPSIS to evaluate the optimum blend. First the ANN model was developed to predict the performance, combustion and emission parameters of the engine. A multi-layer perception network was used for non-linear mapping between input and output parameters. The performance of the ANN model is determined and shows the efficiency of the model to predict the performance, emission and combustion parameters, with a determination coefficient of 0.9627. Second, GA was used to determine the optimum load and blend based on the predicted ANN output parameter. Third, an approach based on the TOPSIS method was used for finding the best blend from the observed optimum parameters of GA. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In recent years, biofuels have attracted considerable attention as a renewable and clean source of energy and have been playing the role of suitable alternatives to fossil fuels. One of the most attractive types of biofuels is Acetone-Butanol-Ethanol (ABE), which is produced in a batch fermentation process by the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum and sugar-based substrate as feedstock. In this paper, the optimization of this process was carried out according to a bi-objective function. A hybrid model of Multi-Objective Differential Evolution (MODE) algorithm and distinguished decisionmaking methods, namely linear programming technique for multidimensional analysis of preference (LINMAP), Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), and Shannon's entropy, were applied to find the final optimal operating point. The initial concentration of substrate and the final operating time of the process were selected as decision variables to maximize the two main objectives in terms of solvent yield and productivity. A Pareto optimal set presents a wide range of optimal operating points, and a proper operating condition can be selected based on the necessities of the applicant. The best optimal point obtained by TOPSIS, according to the lowest value of deviation index, was also compared with the results of the economy-based optimization. © 2019 Sharif University of Technology.

AB  - An experimental research is performed to determine the performance qualities of a variable compression engine at constant speed using copper oxide nanoparticles as being fuel-borne additives in diesel-biodiesel blend. In this research, the effects of adding CuO2 nanoparticles to neochloris oleoabundans methyl ester-diesel blended (B20) fuel on compression-ignition engine had been experimentally investigated. The B20 with 25, 50, 75, and 100ppm dosage of CuO2 nanoparticles were examined at various engine loads and constant engine speed. The fuel blends were labelled as B20, B20+25ppm, B20+50ppm, B20+75ppm and B20+100ppm. Moreover, even without the any engine alterations, the performance properties of those fuel blend samples were investigated through the experimentally measured standards like viscosity, density, cloud point, calorific value and pour point while the engine performance has also been examined through the factors like EGT, BSFC, and BTE. The experimental outcomes show that the use of biodiesel blend along with CuO2 nano particles in diesel fuelled engine has revealed good improvement in performance. © Author.

AB  - Governments around the world are planning to ban sales of vehicles running on petroleum-based fuels as an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and electric vehicles surfaced as a solution to decrease pollutants produced by the transportation sector. As a result, wireless power transfer technology has recently gained much attention as a convenient and practical method for charging electric vehicles. In this paper, patent analysis is conducted to identify emerging and vacant technology areas of wireless power transfer. Topics are first extracted from patents by text mining, and the topics with similar semantics are grouped together to form clusters. Then, the process of identifying emerging and vacant technology areas is improved by applying a time series analysis and innovation cycle of technology to the clustering result. Lastly, the results of clustering, time series, and innovation cycle are compared to minimize the possibility of misidentifying emerging and vacant technology areas, thus improving the accuracy of the identification process and the validity of the identified technology areas. The analysis results revealed that one emerging technology area and two vacant technology areas exist in wireless power transfer. The emerging technology area identified is circuitries consisting of transmitter coils and receiver coils for wireless power transfer, and the two vacant technology areas identified are wireless charging methods based on resonant inductive coupling and wireless power transfer condition monitoring methods or devices. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Biodiesel, or fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE), is an environmentally safe, next-generation biofuel. Conventionally, FAEE is produced by the conversion of oil/fats, obtained from plants, animals, and microorganisms, by transesterification. Recently, metabolic engineering of bacteria for ready-to-use biodiesel was developed. In Escherichia coli, it is produced by fatty acyl-carrier proteins and ethanol, with the help of thioesterase (TesB) and wax synthase (WS) enzymes. One of the foremost barriers in microbial FAEE production is the feedback inhibition of the fatty acid (FA) operon (fabHDG). Here, we studied the effect of biodiesel biosynthesis in E. coli with an engineered fabHDG operon. With a basic FAEE producing BD1 strain harboring tes and ws genes, biodiesel of 32 mg/L were produced. Optimal FAEE biosynthesis was achieved in the BD2 strain that carries an overexpressed operon (fabH, fabD, and fabG genes) and achieved up to 1291 mg/L of biodiesel, a 40-fold rise compared to the BD1 strain. The composition of FAEE obtained from the BD2 strain was 65% (C10:C2, decanoic acid ethyl ester) and 35% (C12:C2, dodecanoic acid ethyl ester). Our findings indicate that overexpression of the native FA operon, along with FAEE biosynthesis enzymes, improved biodiesel biosynthesis in E. coli. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - In this work, the possibility of using planar droplet sizing (PDS) based on laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and Mie scattering was investigated within the framework of measuring the droplet Sauter mean diameter (SMD) of direct-injection spark-ignition (DISI) spray systems. For this purpose, LIF and Mie signals of monodisperse fuel droplets produced by a droplet generator were studied at engine relevant diameters (20-50 μm). The surrogate gasoline fuel Toliso (consisting of 65 vol. % isooctane, 35 vol. % toluene) and the biofuel blend E20 (consisting of 80 vol. % Toliso, 20 vol. % ethanol) were used and which were doped with the fluorescence dye "nile red". The effects of ethanol admixture, dye concentration, laser power, and temperature variation on the LIF/Mie ratio were studied simultaneously at both macroscopic and microscopic scale. The deduced calibration curves of the LIF and Mie signals of both fuels showed volumetric and surface dependent behaviors, respectively, in accordance with the assumptions in the literature. The existence of glare points and morphology-dependent resonances (MDRs) lead to slightly higher LIF and Mie exponents of E20 in comparison to Toliso. In principle, these calibration curves enable the determination of the SMD from LIF/Mie ratio images of transient fuel sprays. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Original biofuels are delivered from sugars, starches, or vegetable oils. Despite what might be expected, the second era biofuels are delivered from cellulosic materials, agrarian squanders, switch grasses and green growth instead of sugar and starch. By not utilizing nourishment crops, second era biofuel creation is significantly more reasonable and has a lower effect on sustenance generation. Otherwise called progressed biofuels, the second-age biofuels are still in the advancement arrangement. Joining higher vitality yields, bring down necessities for manure and arrive, and the nonappearance of rivalry with sustenance, second era biofuels, when accessible at costs comparable to oil determined items, offer a really economical option for transportation energizes. There are principle four issues identified with alternative energizes: creation, transportation, stockpiling, taking care of and use. This section exhibits a survey of late writing identified with the elective energizes utilization and the effect of these powers on fuel infusion frameworks, and fuel atomization and splashes for both start and pressure start motors. Impact of these inexhaustible energizes on both interior stream and outside stream attributes of the fuel injector will be introduced. Right now ethanol is the most generally utilized sustainable fuel in the Assembled States with up to 10% by volume mixed into gas for customary start motors or up to 85% for use in Flex-Fuel vehicles intended to keep running with higher centralizations of ethanol. Biodiesel is likewise utilized with 5-20% by volume mixed into oil based diesel for pressure start motors. Biodiesel fuel is methyl or ethyl esters got from a wide assortment of sustainable sources, for example, vegetable oils, creature fats and cooking oil. © BEIESP.

AB  - Large amounts of lignin are produced in the pulp and paper industry and are still not used in a more valuable way. Lignin has great potential as a renewable raw material for the production of biofuels and high value chemical products. The aim of the present work was to study the hydropyrolysis process of two industrial Kraft lignin types and evaluate the influence of operating temperature and the addition of two acid catalysts: a widely known commercial zeolite (ZSM-5) and niobic acid (HY-340), which has been poorly explored as a catalyst applied to biomass. HY-340, Nb2O5·nH2O, as well as commercial zeolites, has desirable acidic properties, and a low cost compared to traditional catalysts employed in catalytic pyrolysis. The composition of the vapors produced in a micropyrolyzer (CDS-5200) was analyzed in an online gas chromatograph coupled to a mass spectrometer (PY-GC/MS). The effects of operational parameters, such as reaction temperature and catalyst concentration added to lignins, were also investigated. The results showed that the use of ZSM-5 as a catalyst in hydropyrolysis reactions of both lignins promotes a significant increase in the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons. In the tests performed, the increase in selectivity for aromatic hydrocarbons reached a maximum of 98% of the area for lignin 1 and 99% for lignin 2. The addition of HY-340 in the reactions of catalytic hydropyrolysis of the industrial lignins resulted in an increase in the selectivity of open chain or aliphatic hydrocarbons, mainly n-alkanes, which reached a maximum value of 93% of area for lignin 1 and 92% for lignin 2. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The paper brings into the spotlight the concept of smart city, emerging from major economic, social and environmental considerations and developed to provide new possibilities for the inhabitants, but also to limit the impact of human activities on the environment. Thus, the authors initiate a presentation of attempts to define the smart city, highlighting the six dimensions on its development in a sustainable context. Moreover, as one of the greatest challenges of mankind today is to ensure the increasing demand for energy by maintaining the balance with the environment, the paper highlights aspects regarding the use of a form of renewable energy, known as bioenergy. This is one of the key factors for ensuring the sustainable development of smart cities and beyond. Taking into account that smart cities have a smart energy approach, in the last part of the paper the authors present ways to integrate bioenergy into the functioning of such urban areas in Europe and build a map of smart European cities which make use of bioenergy in the benefit of population’s consumption. © 2019, Research Centre in Public Administration and Public Services,cademy of Economic Studies, Bucharest, Romania.

AB  - Phytoremediation is a cost-effective and ecologically friendly process that involves the use of plants to uptake, accumulate, translocate, stabilize, or degrade pollutants. The present study was conducted to demonstrate the potential of pea (Pisum sativum L. spp. sativum) cultivar Blauwschokker to phytostimulate biodiesel degradation in an agricultural soil, considering the influence of biological remediation on selected physiological parameters of plants and the amount and activity of soil microflora. Biodiesel was spiked into soil in dose of 50 g kg−1 of dry mass soil. The results of the study showed that the rate of biodiesel degradation in the vegetated soil was higher than that occurring by natural attenuation. At the same time, biodiesel showed a positive effect on the growth, development, and activity of soil bacteria and fungi. Moreover, the obtained results showed an improvement in physiological parameters of plants, including an increase in chlorophyll a and total chlorophyll content and higher relative water content in leaves in the presence of biodiesel. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Biodiesel appears to be a possible substitute for non-renewable fossil fuels; however, its production requires the presence of a catalyst to accelerate the reaction. Serving the purpose of finding effective, cheap and environmentally safe, heterogeneous catalysts, this research used the fig leaves in three different forms, calcined, activated by KOH, and activated by both K2CO3 and CaCO3. Their efficiency in biodiesel synthesis, from spent cooking oil, was examined and compared with that of activated carbon which has been previously investigated. The properties of different catalyst forms were specified using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Operating parameters studied for the three catalysts were reaction time (from 30 to 180 min), alcohol-to-oil molar ratio (from 4:1 to 10:1), catalyst loading (from 0.5 to 5% by wt.), and stirring speed (from 100 to 400 rpm). The increase in reaction time, molar ratio, and catalyst loading proved to have a favorable effect on % conversion to biodiesel but to a certain degree; increasing the stirring speed augmented the conversion. At optimum conditions (2 h of heating, 6:1 alcohol-to-oil molar ratio, 1% by wt. catalyst loading, and 400 rpm stirring), fig leaves activated by KOH provided the highest conversion to biodiesel (92.73%). The measured properties of the produced biodiesel (density, viscosity, flash point, cloud point, and pour point) yielded encouraging results.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the juice of the fescue grain sorghum, since it is a low-cost agricultural waste, for the production of bioethanol to be used as a gasoline additive. In addition, the octane number has been investigated by varying the ethanol-gasoline mixture 2, 6 and 10%. RESULTS: The wort fermentation was carried out with commercial bread yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The liquor obtained was characterized and quantified through gas chromatography. Bioethanol–gasoline mixtures were prepared as: 2, 6 and 10% v/v to determine their octane index. Bioethanol was purified in a fractional distillation tower, attaining thereby a 93.5% purity: lastly, it was dehydrated through molecular sieves to obtain a 99.2% final purity bioethanol. Spectroscopy aided also to determine that the bioethanol–gasoline mixture containing 10% ethanol attained an octane index of 89, which is the value required for commercial gasoline in Mexico. CONCLUSION: The bioethanol obtained from the fermentation of juice of fescue grain sorghum is indeed viable to be used as additive in gasolines. The fermentation can be carried out with the bread yeast, at the natural pH of the juice and without the addition of nutrients, which leads to an attractive economic process. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - This paper discusses a preliminary design and a techno-economic analysis of a process that produces liquid hydrocarbon fuels from biomass through a combined biochemical and thermochemical process. The biochemical component involves anaerobic digestion (AD) of the biomass's biodegradable portion to produce biogas. Biogas is purified by removing contaminants and upgraded to liquid hydrocarbon fuel in a biogas to liquid facility (BGTL) via thermochemical conversion route. The BGTL process involves two major steps: tri-reforming to produce syngas (a mixture of CO and H2), and, Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) to convert the syngas to a spectrum of hydrocarbons (synthetic crude). Separation and upgrading of the produced hydrocarbon mixture allows production of transportation fuels such as gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel. In order to evaluate the economics of the combined process a detailed process modelling was carried out using Aspen Plus® software. Bench-scale experimental results served as the basis of modelling the BGTL section of the plant, while the AD portion of the plant is based on empirical models selected from the literature validated by comparison with experimental results. Recent bench scale tests in our lab were used to determine processing parameters (yield, temperature, and pressure) for the reforming and FTS conversion. A plant capable of processing 90,000 tonne year−1 of wet biomass feed was designed and analyzed using the model. Results of the economic analysis estimate that a breakeven cost of diesel of $1.30 L-1 is achievable without the consideration of charging tipping fees to accept the biomass feedstock. Sensitivity study shows that the economics are significantly affected by the fixed capital investment (FCI) and less so by the operating expenses and interest rate. In addition, tipping fees and biomass feedstock cost have a substantial effect on the breakeven price of diesel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The hydrothermal pretreatment route is gaining research interest as a potentially green method for deconstructing lignocellusic biomass. Based on the relevant literature, the conversion of biomass into platform chemicals or energy carriers through hydrothermal processes has been found to be advantageous by reason of enhanced process performance, while being environmentally friendly and technologically innovative. In this review, an assessment has been made of recent research findings and reservations in regard to the synthesis of subcritical and supercritical hydrolysates and the production of platform chemicals namely ethanol, butanol, furfural, hydroxymethylfurfural, lactic acid, levulinic acid and its derivatives, succinic acid, sorbitol, and xylitol. This review also proposes a number of future research-oriented directions to harness the findings of primary research-oriented efforts for developing technically and economically feasible large-scale systems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The significant growth aviation has been observing is increasing the sector's pressure on the environment; in the EU28, passengers travelling by air in 2016 increased of 5.9% compared to 2015. The aviation industry voluntarily committed to significant aspirational goals, and identified bio-based aviation fuels as a potential means to improve its environmental performance. Despite of that, the market penetration of aviation biofuels in EU28 is almost negligible. In this paper, an assessment of the likely aviation biofuels demand has been carried out, under a baseline scenario of increasing total fuel consumption of +3% for 2016–2020 and + 3.5% up to 2030; the CO2 intensity of this growth has been calculated accordingly. Europe is a World leader in biofuel technologies; the current potential aviation biofuels is based on the HVO/HEFA technology, and the upper limit of the installed capacity can be considered approximately 2.4 Mt y−1. Nevertheless, lower production volumes can be expected as production plants are today optimized for road fuel production, not aviation. By 2025 the situation may change, with a total production capacity of 3.5 Mt y−1, and with an average potential production for aviation biofuels ranging 0.5–2 Mt y−1. The paper shows that even if today's EU nominal capacity appears large enough to support the expected aviation biofuels demand, other bottlenecks may limit the real market uptake: availability of sustainable feedstocks, competition with demand for road transport sector, etc. For this reason, a comparison of the cost for CO2 saving of other potential solutions to mitigate aviation's climate impact has also been carried out. © 2019

AB  - Recently, an “old weed”, pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.) has become an attractive non-food oilseed crop for Europe and the USA. Pennycress can be produced with existing farm equipment and infrastructure while being grown in the off-season between conventional commodity crops. The adaptation to marginal lands and the satisfactory seed yields make pennycress a viable alternative feedstock for biofuels. In the last decade, pennycress has been extensively studied as a potential oilseed crop in the USA, while receiving far less attention in Europe. Differences in climate and agricultural management between USA and Europe may not permit direct translation of pennycress agronomic knowledge across diverse environments. In the present study, sowing date and seeding rate of pennycress were evaluated in different European (Italy and Greece) and US (Minnesota and Illinois) locations to optimize site-specific production, and determine environmental influence on pennycress-derived biofuel. Pennycress productivity increased with seeding rate up to 1500 m−2 in Europe, but only to 672 m−2 in USA, while sowing in early autumn always improved yields. Seed yield of about 1 Mg ha-1 was achieved only in Greece, where adequate precipitation during the growing season was available. Seed yields were 250% and 140% higher in Greece and Italy, respectively, than Minnesota. Pennycress oil was suitable to convert into biofuel and its composition was influenced by growing environment. In Greece, polyunsaturated fatty acid content was 6% compared to Italy and Illinois. However, the oxidative stability of pennycress oil needs improvement to meet EU and US standards for biodiesel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To reduce carbon emissions, the European Union has implemented the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) since 2012 for intra-European commercial flights. In response, airlines have explored various means, including sustainable jet fuels. This article investigates how similar ETS policy would affect domestic carbon emissions when implemented in the United States. The study integrates a model of airlines operations optimization and multi-feedstock biojet fuels life cycle assessment to simulate decisions of biojet fuel and commercial aviation industry responding to an emission policy. We conduct a Monte-Carlo simulation on two scenarios of domestic emission schemes to investigate the adoption of biojet fuels and its impacts on carbon emissions. Our model indicates that implementing an emission policy for U.S. airlines could incentivize adoption of biofuels - a median value of 10% of total fuels in 2050- while only marginally reduce travel demand. Because of a combined effect of emission policy and improved aircraft technology, the emissions in 2050 would only increase 1.37 times the 2005 level despite passenger demand grows by a factor of 2.75. A non-parametric sensitivity analysis suggests that the price of oil, economic growth, and carbon price are the three most significant factors in affecting the fleet-level carbon emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Overuse of petroleum and ongoing carbon-di-oxide (CO2) rise in the air of Brunei Darussalam has been emerged as a major environmental concern in this country. To resolve this issue, a comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) of alternative biofuel, bioethanol production from microalgae was demanded for realistic implementation. Therefore, LCA of bioethanol production from microalgae in terms of CO2 emission and energy balance was investigated based on the scenario of industrial-scale in Brunei Darussalam. This study demonstrated that 220 tons microalgae biomass was cultivated on 6 ha offshore lands for commercial bioethanol generation. The annual outcome of this commercial bioethanol plant has revealed net CO2 balance 218.86 ton. From the energy perspective, this study manifested itself as favourable with net energy ratio, 0.45 and net energy balance, −2749.6 GJ y−1. Apart from CO2 balance and energy generation aspect, the project demanded low water and land footprints. For photobioreactor cultivation, water and land footprints were 2 m3 GJ−1 and 2 m2 GJ−1, respectively as well as for open pond approach, they were 87 m3 GJ−1 and 13 m2 GJ−1, respectively. The project also presented microalgae growth supplements (phosphorus and nitrogen) accumulation possibilities from wastewater of manure and industries which is another positive aspect for benign environment. Overall, the commercial plant presented low CO2 emission, low land and water demand for microalgae cultivation, alternative eco-friendly and cheaper nutrients sources, quite high energy generation with main product and by-products. Thus, this study projected positive impact on energy and environmental aspects of microalgae-to-bioethanol conversion. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The newest endeavor by the Brazilian State for fostering bioenergy - the National Biofuel Policy, or simply RenovaBio - aims at establishing a mechanism for the commercialization of decarbonization credits linked to the carbon intensity of several biofuels. Under this horizon, this study evaluates the prospects for large-scale, integrated sugarcane-microalgae biorefineries in terms of their techno-economic and environmental feasibility, as well as the possible benefits brought by the RenovaBio program. Process integration was based on different energy and material vectors obtained from the sugarcane mill, especially the use of fermentation-derived CO2, CO2 in biogas, and vinasse as carbon sources for microalgae growth. Results show that the co-location of microalgae production with sugarcane mills leads to verticalized biorefineries currently behind in economic performance in comparison to conventional sugarcane mills due to an increase in both fixed and operational expenses. Anhydrous ethanol production costs remain in the range of US$ 0.36–0.42/L, below the market price of US$ 0.51/L. Integrating a microalgae facility with a sugarcane mill also helps to further improve the sustainability of anhydrous ethanol production: cradle-to-grave emissions of greenhouse gases fluctuate around 18 g CO2eq/MJ, a reduction of 15% in comparison to conventional sugarcane-based ethanol. Depending on the scenario, a reasonably-sized integrated biorefinery would be able to mitigate around 500 thousand t CO2eq/year when displacing gasoline with anhydrous ethanol. The analysis finally points out to integrated sugarcane-microalgae biorefineries becoming economically feasible at carbon prices as low as US$ 10/t CO2eq under the RenovaBio scheme. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Anaerobic Digestion (AD) is a well-developed sustainable technology to convert organic waste streams and energy crops to produce renewable gaseous biofuels, while recycling nutrients and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. In this study, the environmental and economic impacts of an integrated-state AD technology (i-AD) producing Compressed Natural Gas (noted as BioCNG) were investigated from dairy-manure, food-wastes, and miscanthus biomass feedstocks, and compared with that of stand-alone liquid-state (LS-AD) and solid-state (SS-AD) AD technologies. A coupled life-cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis (LCA‐TEA) approach was used to estimate the Global Warming Potential (GWP) and the Minimum Selling Price (MSP) of BioCNG ‒ a renewable alternative to fossil-CNG. The results illustrated that the Fossil Energy Ratios (FERs) for BioCNG were between 2.3 and 3.3 in the increasing order as LS‐AD &lt; i‐AD &lt; SS‐AD. The life-cycle GWPs to produce BioCNG via LS‐AD, SS‐AD, and i‐AD were −5.1, −15.1, and −12.0 kgCO2eq/GGE (Gasoline-Gallon-Equivalent) respectively. The MSP of BioCNG (without incentives) via LS‐AD ($2.9/GGE) was lower than that of both SS‐AD ($4.1/GGE) and i‐AD ($4.9/GGE). When the tipping-fee ($44/Mg), RIN(Renewable Index Number)-credit ($0.46/RIN), and carbon-credit($13.6/MgCO2eq) were considered, the MSP of BioCNG dropped by up to 70%, 45%, and 25% for LS‐AD, SS‐AD, and i‐AD, respectively. Fungal-pretreatment of miscanthus had negligible impacts on the environmental and economic performances of BioCNG. Backhauling of solid-digestate for miscanthus cultivation may reduce the MSP, energy usage, and GWP by up-to 5%, 16%, and 7%, respectively. The commercial production of BioCNG from energy crops can potentially be competitive at a higher BioCNG market price or with favorable energy policies, financial support, and tax-benefits. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This is the first report on an ecofriendly process for producing FAMEs and β-farnesene via a two-stage biotransformation of waste cooking oils (WCOs), in which the FAMEs are referred to as biodiesel products and β-farnesene is used as a jet biofuel. First, the yield of FAMEs from untreated WCOs by Novozym 435 was 33% under the initial transesterification conditions with crude glycerol containing 46% (w/w) methanol. However, crude glycerol with highly concentrated methanol seriously inhibited fermentation for the production of β-farnesene by an engineered E. coli strain with a relatively balanced mevalonate (MVA) pathway that was constructed with the recombinant plasmids pMevT, pMBIS and pFiI. The pretreatment of WCOs and optimization of the transesterification process were successfully performed to completely eliminate fermentation repression, and the methanol content in the crude glycerol was reduced to zero. The production of β-farnesene (5.29 g/L) using this crude glycerol as a substrate was approximately 50% higher than that (3.56 g/L) produced under the initial conditions, which was more than 100% higher than that (2.62 g/L) produced using crude glycerol via chemical transesterification methods. Furthermore, the optimal transesterification process resulted in a sharply increased yield of FAMEs (96%) compared that (33%) obtained under the initial conditions. Therefore, this biotechnology achieved a high FAMEs yield and β-farnesene production and might be suitable for industrial-scale implementation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper aims to examine the influence of various catalysts on biodiesel production, especially from non-food feedstocks with an ambition to optimize the catalytic biodiesel production. Homogenous acid catalysts are mainly used in biodiesel production, but they cannot be recovered and demand costly fuel purification as being corrosive. Similarly, enzyme catalysts are expensive in industrial-scale production of biodiesel. However, heterogeneous catalysts simplify the easy separation of product and by-products from the catalyst along with catalyst reusability and reduction of waste. Solid acid and base catalysts offer more advantages due to their non-toxicity, high surface area, reusability, higher stability, and the simplicity of purification. Solid base catalysts yield better activity than solid acid catalysts, however, they cannot esterify large amounts of free fatty acids (FFAs) in non-food feedstocks. The solid acid catalysts have the added advantages of being more tolerant to high amounts of FFAs and being able to simultaneously esterify FFAs and transesterify triglycerides in cheap feedstocks like waste cooking oil. Recently, an array of inorganic, organic and polymeric solid acid and nanomaterial-based catalysts have been developed using cheap feedstocks. However, the issues of low reactivity, small pore sizes, low stabilities, long reaction times, and high reaction temperatures still need to be solved. The developments of producing efficient, cheap, durable, and stable solid acid and nanomaterial-based catalysts have been critically reviewed in this study. Furthermore, the challenges and future perspectives of production of biodiesel and its industry growth have also been discussed. © 2019

AB  - The catalytic etherification of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) with t-butanol to a biofuel additive 5-(t-butoxymethyl) furfural (t-BMF) is studied by screening 27 heterogeneous protic and/or Lewis acids. Preyssler heteropolyacid H14[NaP5W30O110] and Montmorillonite-based CLOI_CSP catalysts are identified as the most efficient ones, allowing the etherification to reach the t-BMF/HMF equilibrium faster (≈1:1), thus promoting minimum side reactions. Further optimization of the batch experimental conditions, namely catalyst loading, temperature, HMF concentration, time, t-BMF stability, and additives, allows the t-BMF/HMF equilibrium to be reached in less than 3 h with outstanding selectivity &gt;95%. Under optimized conditions, CLOI_CSP is reused for four cycles without significant loss of efficiency. In addition, it exhibits high efficiency under flow conditions, allowing continuous production of t-BMF up to 0.7 g t-BMF g−1 catalyst min−1 at high concentrations of HMF. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - In this modern era, an increase in urbanization causes the escalating trend of fuel demand as well as environmental pollution problems. Various biofuels research with the respect of climate change and emission reduction recently intensifies, particularly in biodiesel. In Indonesia, diesel oil currently in use contains 20% of biodiesel. Utilizing waste-based resources such as rendered chicken tallow as the feedstock could be the solution to both energy and environmental challenges. However, chicken tallow contains a significant amount of free fatty acid (FFA) which will obstruct the production yield of biodiesel. In this study, catalyst-free subcritical methanol has been employed to convert waste chicken tallow (WCT) with high FFA into biodiesel. Design of experiment was conducted to study the effect of temperature, time, and the molar ratio of methanol to fats on the purity and recovery of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). Based on the optimization study performed by response surface methodology (RSM), all three independent variables gave a significant effect on the recovery of FAME. From the experimental results, the maximum FAME yield obtained was 98.43 ± 0.22% with the optimum condition as follows: 167°C, 36.8 minutes, and 42.7:1 (methanol/WCT, mol/mol), while the predicted FAME yield obtained using RSM was 97.76%. The methyl ester composition of WCT-based biodiesel ranges from C13 to C24. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Lignin is the second-most abundant biopolymer on the Earth and it is hard to valorize without pretreatment due to its inherent heterogeneity and recalcitrance. Nowadays, it is necessary to develop effective innovative methods for lignin degradation and efficient utilization. In the present study, the lignolytic bacterium Mycobacterium smegmatis LZ-K2 was isolated from rotten wood. The isolate showed high lipid production and high efficiency of lignin degradation. The lipid production of LZ-K2 grown in corn straw medium with alkali pretreatment, acid pretreatment, and without chemical pretreatment were 0.083 g/L, 0.069 g/L, and 0.072 g/L, respectively. Fatty acids (C14-C24), especially palmitic acid (C16:0; 38.9%), were also accumulated in the untreated corn straw cultures. Results confirmed that the enzyme system and Fenton reaction are the major pathways for lignin depolymerization. In addition, the presence of a critical lignin-degrading enzymes, other than cellulase and hemicellulase, was revealed by the genome analysis. Moreover, the proteome of LZ-K2 showed enzymes, mainly glucose-methanol-choline (GMC) oxidoreductases, which are involved in the Fenton reaction and β-ketoadipate pathway. Unique enzymes of oleaginous microorganisms, such as acetyl CoA carboxylase, were also identified in LZ-K2. In conclusion, the present work provides a sustainable approach for efficient conversion of lignin into biodiesel with simultaneous biological pretreatment of lignocelluloses. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, the potential advantages of fuels derived from coffee waste were evaluated and quantified over the entire life cycle. Life cycle evaluation is important for achieving robust understanding because it covers the entire sequence of stages of fuel production and utilization. Coffee waste collection and transport, oil extraction, and biodiesel production and transport are the stages covered under the first life phase, called “well-to-pump.” Extensive engine tests were also conducted to assess the second life phase, “pump-to-wheel.” Environmental, economic, energetic, and technical criteria were encapsulated within the frame of each phase, and various evaluation tools that fit each life stage were adopted. The results showed that coffee biodiesel contributes to an 80.5% reduction in CO2 emissions compared with the hydrocarbon diesel during its life cycle. Moreover, the conversion efficiency of the raw material energy to fuel energy in the case of coffee biodiesel was 10% higher than that of the petro-diesel. An energy amount of 3.45 MJ is associated with coffee biodiesel for each 1 MJ consumed in its life cycle. The economic viability of coffee biodiesel was found to be very sensitive to the price of the coffee solid fuel (biomass pellets). The entire project is feasible only when the price of pellets is 40% of that of wood pellets or higher. Substantial reduction of tailpipe emissions was attained for CO, CO2, and HC, with 45.3%, 5.7%, and 23.6% reductions, respectively, for B20. Reductions of 10.3% and 7.5% were observed in the brake thermal efficiency and brake power, respectively. Thus, coffee biodiesel has significant advantages and potential, and its technological development merits further research. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Bi-oil, the liquid product from biomass fast pyrolysis, is a kind of clean and sustainable fuel. However, its physicochemical characteristics are not stable, which hinder its actual applications. In this research, bio-oil made from rice husk by a commercial-scale biomass fast pyrolysis plant was utilized to investigate the effects of long period storage (two years) under three different conditions: at 4 °C in a refrigerator, at 25 °C in a room, and at outdoors in the nature conditions. In each condition, three samples collected from the upper, middle and the bottom of the containers. The results showed that low temperature (4 °C) can slow down the process of degradation during storage. The bio-oils endure the most severe aging process at 25 °C in a room. The maximum value of the viscosity was obtained from the bottom layer of bio-oil stored at 25 °C (348.5 ± 2.9 mm2 s−1), which is 50.8 times higher than that of the original bio-oil. The alcohols, furans and hydrocarbons are prone to accumulate in the bottom layers. This research could give insight on degradation of bio-oils at the distinct storage conditions and will be useful for designing the storage system and maintaining the quality of bio-oils in transportation and storage. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuel production from renewable resources is becoming an increasingly attractive option given the depletion of fossil fuels and the environmental problems caused by the excessive use of unsustainable energy resources. In this study, an efficient approach is provided for high-quality oxygen-containing fuel production from renewable lignin bio-oil. The results demonstrate that the calcination temperature has a remarkable effect on the catalyst structure, surface Ni content and physico-chemical properties of the Ni/MgO material, all of which result in significantly different performances in the upgrading of lignin bio-oil. At 160 °C for 4 h and 3 MPa of hydrogen, a 98% lignin bio-oil model compound of guaiacol is converted with 97% cyclohexanol selectivity in the presence of 15% Ni/MgO-850. Furthermore, the optimized catalytic system is reusable and shows good catalytic performance in the upgrading of both light and heavy lignin bio-oils, indicating that it is a promising strategy for renewable lignocellulosic biomass valorization. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engines have high efficiency and lower NOx-soot emissions than diesel and gasoline engines. However, these engines suffer from high HC, CO and unregulated emissions and combustion phasing control. The fuel chemistry, charge dilution and fuel injection timing strongly control HCCI combustion. The oxygenated renewable biofuels, such as biodiesel and alcohol, can be used to control combustion. The use of laser diagnostic techniques can provide insight into the combustion chamber for the air–fuel charge formation and combustion studies. The charge stratification achieved using intake air conditioning, dilution or varying the fuel reactivity can overcome the challenges associated with HCCI engines. The review paper examine the critical challenges in the HCCI engine, use of the renewable fuels and their impact on engine-out emissions. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Intense utilization of natural fuel resources is threatening the global environment and societal sustainability. It triggers up the need for finding environmental-friendly and sustainable sources of energy. In this perspective, microalgae have emerged as a potential alternative. Microalgae are featured with distinct ability to provide ecological services and respond to the sustainability challenges simultaneously. Microalgae can fix atmospheric CO2, valorize waste resources and can produce a wide variety of bio-products. The promising features of microalgae pitch the idea of establishing a sustainable bio-refinery to draw multifaceted benefits and reinforce the objectives of resource efficient bio-economy. Unfortunately, in the last few years, preferential studies have been carried out to assess the potential of microalgae-based integrated bio-refinery. This review critically discussed the recent developments, opportunities, and barriers in the microalgae bio-industry and wastewater treatment. Particularly, microalgae potentials for biofuels and resources recovery are addressed towards sustainable biorefinery. Moreover, techno-economic and commercial viability of microalgae-led bio-refinery is reviewed to drive this technology towards practicality. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present work offered a comprehensive investigation on engine characteristics of single cylinder Direct Injection (DI) diesel engine fuelled with Lemon oil (LO) biofuel. LO was obtained from the peels of lemon using steam distillation process. The physio-chemical properties of LO were analysed based ASTM biodiesel standard and compared with diesel. The chemical composition of LO was observed with Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS). In-order to enhance the properties of LO, a cetane enhancer namely Pyrogallol (PY) was added. The engine combustion chamber components namely piston head, cylinder head and intake and exhaust valves were thermally coated with Partially Stabilized Zirconia (PSZ) which converted the conventional engine into low heat rejection engine. In the PSZ coated engine, enhanced performance and combustion characteristics were observed with LO and PY blend. Declined carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC) and smoke emissions were observed with LO and PY blend in coated engine. Further, the work was extended with the application of Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and Catalytic Converter (CC) as post treatment system for the reduction of NOx emission. With post treatment, LO and pyrogallol in PSZ coated engine showed lower NOx emission than diesel and LO. Consequently, LO and pyrogallol in PSZ coated engine with post treatment was considered as more advantageous than other fuel samples on account of its performance, combustion and emission characteristics. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - There is a rapid increase in the air pollution level of the earth atmosphere due to the extreme demand and usage of the petroleum products. The demand has accelerated the recent research to explore an environment-friendly fuels suitable for the performance on the diesel engine. The optimization of the engine parameters using RSM with combination of taguchi method is an important aspect which generates an important optimized model for the responses. In the present study, an investigation of optimum performance and emission parameters of an engine fuelled with jojoba biodiesel is presented. The study also includes the optimization of input parameters to attain corresponding optimal thermal performance of the engine. The input parameters are injection pressure, injection timing of fuel, percentage blends of jojoba based biodiesel and engine load whereas the corresponding output responses such as brake thermal efficiency, peak cylinder pressure, exhaust gas temperature, and hydrocarbon emission are considered for the optimization during the investigation. The experimental design used in the study is based on a central composite rotating design matrix. The best combination of input parameters is recorded at 25°bTDC injection timing of fuel, 21.52 MPa injection pressure of fuel, 24% mixing of jojoba biodiesel with diesel, and 80% engine load which maximum BTE and Pmax minimum EGT and UHC emission of the engine. Experimental and optimized results of the output responses at optimum input parameters are compared and they were found to be in the suggested error range. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Substitution of fossil diesel fuel by biodiesel is a realistic alternative due to its compatibility with commercial diesel engines. However, detractors consider that traditional raw materials used for biodiesel production may compete with human feeding (edible vegetables oils), land and water. So, new raw materials are needed. Annually, around 1.3 billion ton of food are discarded or wasted. This huge figure has led researchers to seek for new applications to this carbon source. The main goal of this work is biodiesel production optimization (with and without auxiliary energy assistance), and further characterization, by using the lipid fraction included in solid food waste, collected from local restaurants. Solid food waste oil (SFWO) characterization showed a fatty acid profile rich in oleic (C18:1), palmitic (C16:0) and linolenic (C18:2) acids, a remarkable fatty acid composition suitable for biodiesel production. Due to high free fatty acid content, acid esterification pre-treatment was conducted, followed by a basic transesterification optimization, by both conventional and ultrasound (US) assisted reactions. Response surface methodology was selected to perform the experimental design; optimal conditions for conventional transesterification were achieved at 6.08:1 methanol-to-oil molar ratio, 1.28% w/w catalyst and 52.5 °C reaction temperature, providing 93.23% w/w fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) conversion. Biodiesel quality was also analyzed with excellent results considering cold properties (cold filter plugging point below −3 °C), although oxidation stability did not fulfill European standard limit. US-assisted reaction was also compared with conventional transesterification in terms of energy consumption and reaction time, providing significant savings in both energy and reaction time (40 min reduction). As a conclusion, US-assisted SFWO biodiesel meets most European standard limits, following circular economy. To extend its use, blends with diesel fuel and antioxidant addition are recommended, besides long-term engine tests. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To sustain economic growth in Bangladesh, energy demand is expected to increase rapidly, resulting in more greenhouse gas emissions, as the energy sector, including transport and electricity, is dominated by fossil fuels. In order to reduce these emissions, the government of Bangladesh has already formed a long-term energy plan, part of which is introducing a 5% blend of bioethanol with gasoline in the transport sector. However, the source of this bioethanol has not yet been identified. An investigation has thus been conducted to evaluate the potential of bioethanol production using wild date palm fruit pulp and sap, sugary biomass of a perennially grown plant in Bangladesh that has been grown for decades without regular agronomic practice. A male plant produced 140.42 kg sugary biomass per year with 29.85% total sugar whereas a female plant yielded 195.56 kg, containing an average of 43.61% of total sugar. A batch fermentation study using Saccharomyces cerevisiae found that fruit pulp extract and sap could be conveniently fermented without nutritional supplementation to potentially yield ethanol. An average of 0.278 g/g ethanol was yielded from the fruit pulp extract and sap fermentation. From these findings, it was estimated that minimum 8076.62 L of ethanol could be obtained from an orchard comprising 500 plants per hectare with the planting ratio of male: female plants of 1:4. This indicates that this biomass of the wild date palm is a highly promising sugary feedstock for the potential production of bioethanol. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biofuels, such as ethanol, have been introduced as a solution to decrease total CO2 emissions from transport sector as well as an alternative to increase the domestic energy security against international fuel price fluctuations. The use of high water content ethanol, the so-called wet ethanol (ethanol with higher than 5% water content v/v), has been proposed to reduce ethanol production cost. This work presents the application of wet ethanol on a naturally aspirated direct injection single cylinder research engine equipped with a fully variable electro-hydraulic valve train running on stoichiometric air/fuel ratio. The negative valve overlap (NVO) strategy was used to retain high residual gas fraction (RGF) at the part load operation of 3.1 bar IMEP and 1500 rpm. Anhydrous ethanol and different wet ethanol compositions (10% and 20% water-in-ethanol content v/v) were tested for several NVO durations, as well as European RON 95 gasoline. A one-dimensional engine model was built and validated against experimental data to estimate the RGF for each operating point. It was possible to achieve stable stoichiometric operation with more than 35% RGF for anhydrous ethanol and RON 95 gasoline. On the other hand, the maximum supported RGF for stable operation decreased as the water-in-ethanol content increased. The increase in water content reduced the tolerance to hot residuals due to lower combustion temperatures, which lengthened the flame initiation and main combustion phases. Even then, the increase in NVO period resulted in net indicated efficiency gains for all fuels due to less pumping losses, lower combustion temperature, and the possibility to maintain combustion efficiency at acceptable levels even with the maximum achievable RGF of each fuel. Anhydrous ethanol presented the highest net indicated efficiencies, while 10% water-in-ethanol mixture presented slightly higher indicated efficiency compared to gasoline. 20% water-in-ethanol mixture provided the lowest indicated efficiencies over the whole range of tested RGF. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study focuses on the potential of four lipogenic yeasts to produce lipids using glycerol as carbon substrate; Candida molendinolei MH267796, Meyerozyma caribbica MH267795 and Rhodotorula minuta MH267794 were isolated from olive oil mill wastewater, while Cryptococcus curvatus ATCC20509 was used as control strain. Lipid production with crude glycerol was higher than that provided with pure glycerol. Fed-batch bioreactor cultures with M. caribbica MH267795 led to the production of 42.12 g L−1 of total dry weight with a microbial oil content of 48.14% (w w−1). In general terms, tested biodiesel properties meet all the limits set by European biodiesel standard UNE 14214:2013, excepting fatty acid methyl ester content. In addition, M. caribbica MH267795 oil biodiesel depicts a fatty acid methyl ester content (90.2% (w w−1)) higher than that of the most intensively studied C. curvatus oil biodiesel. Re-use of crude glycerol as raw material in biodiesel industry has been proven through fermentation, increasing potential full-scale application of such alternative. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study has investigated feasibility to use ethanol in a compression ignition engine by blending it with diesel fuel, called diesohol. Additionally, biodiesel, acting as a co-solvent, is mixed into diesohol to prevent phase separation. Three blended ratios including B3E5, B7E5 and B10E10 were selected to conduct fuel property analysis and the engine test. In addition, commercial diesel in Thailand (B7) was used as a referent fuel. A commercial diesel engine with common rail fuel system was used to measure engine performance, fuel consumption, exhaust gas emissions including aldehydes as well as combustion characteristics. Benefits of using the diesohol fuel in pickup truck were also investigated. The results showed that with increasing ethanol fraction, the biodiesel fraction needed to be increased to prevent phase separation. When ambient temperature was decreased the phase separation could easily occur. Engine torque and power decreased when percentage of ethanol increased. In-cylinder pressure analysis showed that pilot combustion was moderated and retarded due to higher heat of vaporization of ethanol. With ethanol fraction increasing, the blended fuels required more time to evaporate, induced to higher heat release rate due to long ignition delay. Hydrocarbon emission was increased with longer period of fuel vaporization and mixing processes while the nitrogen oxide increased with increasing of maximum heat release rate. However, the diesohol can help facilitate biofuel market management by increasing biofuel (both ethanol and biodiesel) from diesel sector. In addition, fossil fuel will be suppressed and global warming impacts will be mitigated with diesohol supported measures. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A biopolymer-based catalyst with an alkaline moiety was prepared by radiation induced grafting (RIG) of glycidylmethaacrylate (GMA) onto flax fibres followed by functionalisation with diethyl amine (DEA) and treatment with NaOH. The density of amine loading was tuned by optimisation of the reaction parameters including DEA concentration, reaction temperature, and time using the Box–Behnken Design (BBD) of Response Surface Methodology (RSM). The chemical composition, morphology and structure of the alkaline catalyst were examined using Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. Thermal properties of the catalyst were examined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The optimum parameters for obtaining a maximum amine density (3.65 mmol/g) in the catalyst were 79.8% DEA concentration, 80 °C reaction temperature, and 2.9 h reaction time. The catalyst was tested for transesterification of cottonseed oil with methanol. A maximum 88.6% conversion to fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) was achieved at optimum parameters of 33:1 methanol/oil molar ratio, 2.5 wt% catalyst concentration and 60 °C reaction temperature. The results indicate that radiation induced grafting can be effectively used to prepare alkaline biocatalyst catalyst from flax fibres and the catalyst is a promising green candidate for biodiesel production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - As yet, the effect of biodiesels on the emissions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) from heavy-duty diesel engines (HDDEs) has only been studied using limited fuel blend ratios. To clarify the influence of using higher fractions of biodiesel on the emissions of toxic organic pollutants from diesel engines, in this research, the emissions of PM, PAHs, and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) from EURO IV and EURO III HDDEs fueled by low to high waste cooking oil (WCO)-based biodiesel-petrodiesel fuel blends were studied, including D100 (0% biodiesel), B20 (20%), B40 (40%), B60 (60%), B80 (80%), and B100 (100%). The engines were tested according to the US FTP-75 test procedure. The results for the EURO IV diesel engine showed that the PM and toxic organic pollutant emissions were reduced with increases in the blending ratio up until the B60 scenario when compared to the D100 scenario. This is because biodiesel has higher oxygen content and no or lower aromatic content than petrodiesel. Nevertheless, during the B80 and B100 scenarios, the PM and toxic organic pollutant emissions increased due to the high viscosity property of biodiesel, which negatively affected the combustion process. The biodiesel effect on the emissions from EURO III engine was more pronounced because of its lower combustion efficiency, and therefore the improvement in combustion using biodiesel resulted in greater PCDD/F reductions. © 2019

AB  - Water consumption and pollution in wheat production, which are worth paying attention in agricultural countries and arid regions, need to be assessed systematically and comprehensively. China, one of the largest wheat-producing country in the world, should be concerned about this issue. Thus, an impact-oriented water footprint assessment of wheat production in China was conducted based on the ISO 14046 standard to quantify water-related environmental impacts. We quantified the environmental impacts on human health and ecosystem quality categories of wheat production from 2009 to 2016 and evaluated the spatial variation of these categories in 2016. Results showed that the environmental impacts on human health and ecosystem quality categories in 2016 were 5.15 × 10−4 DALY/t and 37.17 PDF·m2·yr/t, respectively. Key factor analysis showed that the overall environmental impacts were primarily derived from fertilizer production, diesel production, and direct water consumption and emission. The dynamic analysis results revealed that the temporal variations in impacts were associated with water and fertilizer consumption. Areas with high potential impacts were mainly congregated in the North China Plain and Xinjiang Province due to their high wheat yields. Ecosystem quality was negatively correlated with wheat yield, and human health was positively correlated with crop water requirement. Therefore, on the basis of ensuring grain production, improving the utilization efficiency of irrigation water and reducing fertilizer and diesel consumption are the priorities for the management of agricultural water resources. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Oil from forage turnip (Raphanus sativus L) was investigated as a potential non-edible feedstock for ethanolic biodiesel production via transesterification using extrudate pellets of K2CO3/Sepiolite. The mechanical, structural and textural properties of the catalyst were measured using dynamometry, TGA, B.E.T and CO2-TPD. Catalytic performance during biodiesel synthesis in a volumetric glass reactor was evaluated after 2 and 4 h, for different catalyst mass (2, 3 and 5 wt%), oil/ethanol molar ratios (1:6, 1:9 and 1:12) and reaction temperatures (50 and 70 °C). A 99.9% biodiesel yield was obtained after 4 h at 70 °C, with a 1:12 oil/ethanol molar ratio and 2 wt% catalyst. Thus, the use of forage turnip oil for ethanolic biodiesel production using a heterogeneous catalyst (instead of the conventional homogeneous route) is viable. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The transesterification of Pequi (Caryocar brasiliensis Camb.) bio-oil was conduct with a heterogeneous acid catalyst prepared with the fruit's carbonized rinds. The newly-developed catalyst was characterized by TGA/DSC, XRD diffraction, and FTIR analysis. Experiments for process optimization of biodiesel production and catalyst reusability were carried out, also investigating the kinetics involved in bio-oil mass conversion. Crude FAME content was analyzed with GC-FID gas chromatographer and its fuel properties compared to worldwide standards. Main finds were a crude FAME majorly composed by methyl esters of palmitic acid, linoleic acid, and stearic acid, representing about 49.93, 13.24, and 10.16 wt.%, respectively. Optimized conditions for maximum FAME synthesis from Pequi bio-oil (99.4 ± 0.33%) were 18:1 M ratio of methanol to bio-oil, 60 °C of temperature, 100 min of reaction, catalyst load of 2.5 wt.%, and stirring speed of 600 rpm. Kinetics of the bio-oil mass conversion through transesterification presented reaction rates varying from 0.016 to 0.091 min−1, 63.07 kJ kg−1 of activation energy (Ea), and pre-exponential value (A) of 11.4E105. Catalyst efficiency decreased to 34.9% after 10 reuse cycles. Fuel properties of the crude FAME met worldwide standards of biodiesel quality, thus indicate that Pequi bio-oil is a viable, sustainable, and widely available feedstock option in Brazil. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In East Asia, for thousands of years, the fruit of Chinese tallow tree (Sapium sebiferum) has been used for multiple purposes because of its chemical composition; the presence of high amounts of lipids is remarkable, showing potential to be used as substrate for biodiesel synthesis. Previously have been reported the use of alkaline and enzymatic catalysts, microwave technology and the use of ionic liquids as co-solvents with the lipids of this tree species to produce biodiesel. This study shows the results of the use of Burkholderia cepacia lipase as enzymatic catalyst for transesterification of Chinese Tallow Kernel oil (CTK), extracted from the fruit of Chinese tallow tree, into biodiesel, with the use of ultrasonic assisted technology and without the usage of solvents. The optimal operational parameters were determined and the reactions were developed in a batch reactor with the use of ultrasonic irradiation and emulsification to enhance the mass transfer. The scaled-up experiments, in an especially designed 3 L capacity reactor, showed promising results, obtaining 55.20% biodiesel and a kinematic viscosity of 10.31 mm2.s−1 in only 4 h, in comparison with previously published (in vitro) methods. The valorization of this non-edible source of oil represents an opportunity to use as an alternative source for bioenergy and also to tackle the uncontrolled expansion of this oleaginous tree species in some ecologically fragile ecosystems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Food wastes are generated massively across global food supply chains. Conventional treatments of food waste (e.g., landfilling and incineration) cause environmental, economic, and social problems. There is a more sustainable and profitable management option by valorization of food waste into value-added chemicals. Consumer chemicals, including acids, sugars, and their derivatized forms, can be synthesized from food waste. Refined specialty chemicals from food waste ranging from solvents to antioxidant materials can be important for nutraceutical and biomaterial applications. Meanwhile, commodity chemicals derived from food waste such as biofuel, biogas, and biochar help meet the global demand for large-scale reutilization of resources and energy. Niche chemicals (e.g., chitosan, glucose, and free amino nitrogen) converted from food waste also show great prospect in nutrient recycling and use for industrial applications. This paper reviews and discusses the latest technological advances in different physical, chemical, and biological treatments of food waste, such that the productivity of value-added chemicals and cost-effectiveness of these valorization methods can be improved for future scaled-up operations. This paper covers holistic comparison and in-depth discussion regarding the feasibility and sustainability of food waste derived chemicals, together with the market outlook of recycling and valorization of food wastes from state-of-the-art perspectives. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The renewable hydrocarbon-like biofuel from biomass is crucial to substitute fossil fuel. A series of mesoporous Al2O3-TiO2 mixed oxide catalysts with different TiO2 content (0.1Ti-0.9Al, 0.2Ti-0.8Al and 0.3Ti-0.7Al) have been synthesized. The physicochemical properties of the catalysts were characterized by XRD, FESEM-EDX, BET, FTIR, NH3-TPD, FTIR-Py, and TGA. The deoxygenation (DO) of triglyceride (i.e. triolein) was carried out in the absence of hydrogen and solvent. The mesoporous Al2O3-TiO2 catalysts showed high catalytic activity performance as compared to that of Al2O3 and TiO2. It was found that 0.2Ti-0.8Al catalyst exhibited the highest conversion (76.86%), and selectivity (27.26%) toward n-C15 + n-C17 at 380 °C after 4 h. The excellence performance of mesoporous Al2O3-TiO2 was attributed to its acidity, mesoporosity and larger surface area. The results reveal that the mesoporous Al2O3-TiO2 catalyst is a promising catalyst for the synthesis of hydrocarbon-like biofuel. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Dual-fuel strategies can enable replacement of diesel fuel with low reactivity biofuels like hydrous ethanol. Previous work has shown that dual-fuel strategies using port injection of hydrous ethanol can replace up to 60% of diesel fuel on an energy basis. However, they yield negligible benefits in NOX emissions, soot emissions, and brake thermal efficiency (BTE) over conventional single fuel diesel operation. Pretreatment of hydrous ethanol through steam reforming before mixing with intake air offers the potential to both increase BTE and decrease soot and NOX emissions. Steam reforming can upgrade the heating value of the secondary fuel through thermochemical recuperation (TCR) and produces inert gases to act as a diluent similar to exhaust gas recirculation. This study experimentally investigated a novel thermally integrated steam reforming TCR reactor that uses sensible and chemical energy in the exhaust to provide the necessary heat for hydrous ethanol steam reforming. An off-highway diesel engine was operated at three speed and load settings with varying hydrous ethanol flow rates reaching fumigant energy fractions of up to 70%. The engine achieved soot reductions of close to 90% and minor NOX reductions; however, carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbon emissions increased. A first law energy balance using the experimental data shows that the developed TCR system effectively upgraded the heating value of the secondary fuel. Overall, hydrous ethanol steam reforming using TCR can lead to 23% increase in fuel heating value at 100% conversion, a limit approached in the conducted experiments. © 2019 by ASME.

AB  - Castor oil has been widely used as raw material to obtain compounds such as paints, solvents, rubbers, polyurethane polymers and chemical inputs. Then, one highlighted route is thermal cracking of castor oil to produce bio-oil, mainly composed of heptaldehyde and methyl undecenoate, which are used as precursors of lactones in the food and beverage industry. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the separation heptaldehyde and methyl undecenoate by distillation of bio-oil from thermal cracking of the methyl esters in castor oil (MECO). Distilled fractions were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC). Thus, it was possible to concentrate the fractions of heptaldehyde and methyl undecenoate in a section with a distillation system at atmospheric pressure with a distillation rate of 5.0 mL min-1 at 270 °C, which motivates new researches for up-scaling of the process. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, insect biofuel from black soldier fly larvae (BSFL)oil was investigated as a potential alternative fuel in a single cylinder direct injection compression ignition (CI)engine. The neat of BSFL oil and its blends (B25, B50, B75, and B100)were utilized in the engine, in order to identify its combustion, performance, and emission characteristics. This was followed by an experimental performance at a constant speed with variable engine loads. The result showed a slight decrease by 3.28% in the cylinder pressure, with an 8.21% reduction in brake thermal efficiency; while an increment in the brake specific fuel consumption was noticed. Furthermore, there was a decreasing trend of about 19.62% and 1.84% in NOx and O2 respectively. Nevertheless, an increase in CO, CO2, HC, and exhaust gas temperature was also discovered. It could be concluded that, the BSFL oil possesses a high potential to be utilized as an alternative fuel for CI engines in the future. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Alternative fuel components have a continuously growing use worldwide. Hydrocarbons with high hydrogen to carbon ratio in their molecular structures are the most suitable alternative fuels. In this paper the special hydrocracking of waste fatty acids and waste lard to paraffin mixtures over sulfided NiMoP/Al2O3 is presented. The effect of feedstock additives was investigated on the catalyst performance, such as activity, selectivity, product yield and catalyst lifetime. It was concluded that coke precursors, which were formed from olefinic components reduced the catalyst performance. Olefins were generated as intermediates of hydrocracking but could be present also in the feedstocks. Based on the results it was also concluded that application of amine and phenol type additives in the feedstocks inhibited the formation of coke precursors and coke. Results of catalytic tests having length of ca. 1000 h were compared. Applying 200 mg/kg additive in favorable combination resulted in about 21–37 wt% increase in the yield of target products relative to that using feedstock without additives. The obtained target products were rich in n-paraffins and represented diesel blending components of &gt;85 cetane number. Various ideas are proposed for the utilization of the obtained bio-paraffin mixture. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel has been reported as renewable, green fuel with better engine-emission properties and microalgae (like C. pyrenoidosa) derived biodiesel is a step towards the sustainable supply of liquid fuel to drive the world economies. In the present investigation, Biowaste [Dairy wastewater (DWW) and rice straw hydrolysate (RSH)] was used as natural feedstock for the growth of C. pyrenoidosa. The better yield was obtained by using DWW as media for the growth of microalgae. The biodiesel produced was composed of high molecular weight fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), thus confirming its purity. Physico-chemical properties of the biodiesel produced were analyzed and compared with the petrodiesel and with standard analytical methods (ASTM-D6751 and EN 14214:2010). The brake thermal efficiency (BTE) of 42.23%, the calorific value of 41.865 MJ/kg and brake power (BP) 39.99 kW was obtained for the biodiesel produced and has been found to be higher but statistically non-significant in comparison to petrodiesel. However, statistically significant reduction in emission (40–50%) and reduction in CO2 (50–60%) was found in case of biodiesel as compared to petrodiesel. The data presented clearly demonstrates that the engine performance parameters and emission parameters of the biodiesel produced were better than the conventional petrodiesel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lemon peel oil (LPO: C10H16O0.082) shows very similar calorific value, stoichiometric air to fuel ratio as isooctane, an ideal reference fuel for a gasoline engine, and also possesses very good anti-knock tendency and octane number rating (RON = 80) making it possible alternative fuel for gasoline engines. The present study investigates the suitability of LPO for direct injection spark ignition application by contrasting the spray characteristics of LPO with reference fuel isooctane for simulated engine-like conditions. Experiments were performed in a constant volume spray chamber under various engine-like pressure and temperature conditions. A six-hole GDI injector was used to study the spray behavior of LPO and then compared to standard reference fuel, isooctane. The ambient conditions in the chamber were derived using the crank resolved pressure data of the GDI engine. The selected chamber conditions are a) 1.5 bar, 329 K; b) 2.5 bar, 371 K; c) 6.0 bar, 453 K simulating in-cylinder conditions for three different injection timings. Phase Doppler particle analyzer and Mie scatter imaging techniques were employed for spray characterization. Spray morphology along with joint probability distribution for droplet size and axial velocity, cumulative volume fraction and Weber and Reynolds number ranges were used to contrast the two sprays for LPO and isooctane. Results showed that ambient pressure and temperature have a significant effect on spray behavior and late injection in compression stroke is proposed to be ideal for LPO to match the engine performance with that of isooctane based on the spray quality comparison. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper characterizes the morphological and elemental compositions of individual particles in seven micro-environments of Xi’an. Atmospheric particulate matter samples were collected at one suburban site (Duling Park (DL)), three urban sites (roadside site (RS), clear days (CD), dusty days (DD)) and three indoor sites (hot pot (HP), barbecue (BBQ), hospital (HO)) during March–April in 2017. A total of 469 particles were analysed by a scanning electron microscopy with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Seven types of particles were observed, including sulphate particles, iron oxide particles, dust mineral particles, soot, organic aerosols, silicon–aluminium (Si–Al)-rich fly ash and biological particles. Soot accounted for 22% in BBQ, indicating an effect of BBQ coal burning. Sulphate particles were found in high abundance (14–15%) in HP and HO samples, consistent with the occurrence of secondary chemical reactions. Organic aerosols accounted for 13% in HO, 20% in HP and BBQ samples due to cooking of food and human factors. Comparison of samples in indoor and outdoor environments showed that the external transmission of dust mineral particles and Fe oxide particles played a key role in indoor levels. The microscopic analysis also demonstrated that the particles in Xi’an were highly distributed with fine particles (less than 3 µm) and that the morphology of fine particles tended to be spherical. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Nano-crystalline synthetic gismondine modified via cation exchange has been utilised as a highly active and selective catalyst for the production of biofuel. In comparison with low silica zeolites FAU and LTA, K-form of gismondine, based on the maximum aluminium P (MAP) zeolite, exhibited a significant improvement in catalytic performance in the methanolysis of bio-oil, which can be attributed to its nano-particle morphology and high basicity associated with the high Al content and high degree of ion exchange, as demonstrated by the TEM, XRD, TGA, NMR, XPS and CO 2 -TPD studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on a successful catalytic application of basic K-MAP zeolite. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Among different biofuel feedstocks, algal biodiesel is seen as a promising feedstock. Different research papers have assessed the sustainability of algal biofuel production, but it is always difficult to have a better sense of the results since comparing them with all the differences in data sources, life cycle assumptions, functional units and environmental metrics measured is difficult. The present study develops a comparative life cycle assessment of algal biofuel production under autotrophic and heterotrophic conditions with different inputs. SimaPro 8 was used considering five different scenarios for microalgae cultivation to compare environmental impacts, energy demand and damage analysis associated with water scarcity methodology. Open ponds with three different assumptions of using fresh water, recycled water and waste water, and photobioreactor and heterotrophic technologies are considered. Results were analyzed per energy basis—the functional unit of 1 MJ of energy produced. Results of total GHG emissions show that algae cultivated in pond with wastewater and heterotrophic culture are competitive with tradition fossil fuels. Also the use of algae as the source of energy might increase the energy demand, whereas it does not have adverse impact on the environment, health and climate. The results of the water scarcity indicator show the competiveness of algae oil. This study presents an overview of environmental impacts throughout the full life cycle of a product through different pathways in cultivation stage which demonstrates the importance of decision-making process for further investment. © 2018, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - Sewage treatment in a biological compact unit and effluent reuse for cultivation of Jojoba, Jatropha and Castor beans was examined. The biological compact unit includes three zones: settling and anaerobic, aerobic biofilm and final sedimentation. Quality of raw sewage and treated effluents was monitored. Impact of water quality on growth rate of biofuel crops and soil properties was investigated. Reuse of raw sewage for irrigation of biofuel crops has major impact on microbial quality and heavy metals concentration of irrigated soil. Sequence of heavy metals accumulation in the soil was Zn > Cu > Cr > Pb. Castor beans irrigated with the final effluent has the highest growth rate and crop yield followed by Jatropha and Jojoba. Growing Castor beans using treated sewage is economically feasible since the plant produces harvestable seeds during the first year and thereafter. Castor beans yield was highest (1.78 ton/ha) with the final effluent. Estimated market price is $1241/ha. © 2018, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - Coir is a natural, lignin rich, fiber that can be found between the hard internal shell and the outer coat of a coconut. There are multiple products made from coir fibers but a significant amount of fibers accumulating from coconut processing remains unutilized. Coir fibers obtained from ripe (brown fibers) and unripe (white fibers) have a high lignin content about 41–42 wt%, a low ash content &lt; 15 wt% and a high heating value of about 18.5–19 MJ kg−1. The pelletizing properties were studied in a laboratory scale, single pellet press, and produced pellets were of high mechanical properties. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis was used to identify the glass transition temperature of coir lignin and indicated that at the applied conditions the softening of coir lignin occurs at about 120–130 °C, which is the usual temperature reached in an industrial scale pellet mill. These properties make coir a suitable raw material for fuel pellet production. Its high availability makes coir fibers a potential replacement for firewood and charcoal in developing countries, and thereby contributes to reduce deforestation. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Background: The extraction of lipids from microalgae requires a pretreatment process to break the cell wall and subsequent extraction processes to obtain the lipids for biofuels production. The multistep operation tends to incur high costs and are energy intensive due to longer process operations. This research work applies the combination of radicals from hydrogen peroxide with an organic solvent as a chemical pretreatment method for disrupting the cell wall of microalgae and simultaneously extracting lipids from the biomass in a one-step biphasic solution. Result: Several parameters which can affect the biphasic system were analyzed: contact time, volume of solvent, volume ratio, type of organic solvent, biomass amount and concentration of solvents, to extract the highest amount of lipids from microalgae. The results were optimized and up to 83.5% of lipid recovery yield and 94.6% of enhancement was successfully achieved. The results obtain from GC-FID were similar to the analysis of triglyceride lipid standard. Conclusion: The profound hybrid biphasic system shows great potential to radically disrupt the cell wall of microalgae and instantaneously extract lipids in a single-step approach. The lipids extracted were tested to for its comparability to biodiesel performance. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - The aviation industry continues to grow, and consequently, more fuel is needed. With the intention of decarbonising the aviation sector, sustainable routes that have the potential to mitigate emissions, such as biomass fast pyrolysis, can positively contribute to this direction. Within this context, the present study performs a comparative techno-economic evaluation of aviation biofuel manufacture via the main bio-oil upgrading pathways, namely, hydroprocessing (HP), gasification followed by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (G+FT), and zeolite cracking (ZC). The research constitutes the first endeavour to investigate and compare the feasibility of producing biojet fuel via pyrolysis-based routes. The presented work provides an inclusive evaluation that comprises process modelling and financial assessment. Based on the simulations, overall energy efficiencies of 48.8%, 45.73%, and 45.38% and jet fuel energy efficiencies of 23.70%, 21.45%, and 20.53% were calculated, while the implementation of a discounted cash flow analysis estimated minimum jet fuel selling prices (MJSPs) of 1.98, 2.32, and 2.21 $/L for the HP, the G+FT, and the ZC, respectively. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the processes are capital and feedstock intensive while an increase to the bio-oil yield will favour the economic performance of the examined biorefineries. An increase of the plant size from 100 (base case) to 150 dry tonnes per hour of feedstock will decrease the selling prices by approximately 25% for all cases. Monte Carlo simulations exhibited that without establishing and/or maintaining appropriate policy schemes, there is no pragmatic prospect for the examined biorefineries to beat the competition against the prevailing oil infrastructures. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The present research work is to analyze the effect of the ceramic coating materials like Partially Stabilized Zirconia (PSZ), Titanium di-oxide (TiO2), and Radish biodiesel on its performance, combustion, and emission characteristics of single cylinder 4-s, DI diesel engine fueled with diesel and Radish biodiesel blends. In the first phase, Radish seed oil is converted into biodiesel by transesterification process. The properties of biodiesel blends (B0, B25, B50, B75, and B100) are evaluated and presented; tests were conducted at 1500 rpm constant speed with 220 bar of nozzle opening pressure and 23°bTDC of static injection timing as engine setup under steady state condition. The cylinder head, valves, and piston crown of the engine components were coated with 450 µm of PSZ and TiO2 by atmospheric plasma spray coating techniques (APS) for test purpose. From the test results, it could be observed that PSZ-coated mode of operation gives better specific fuel consumption (SFC) than the conventional diesel engine, slight hike in brake thermal efficiency, reduction in hydrocarbon by 16–30% and low level of CO in emissions were observed. However, the NOx increases by 17–23% when compared to conventional engine operation. In case of TiO2-coated mode of operation, slight increase in the SFC is recorded, whereas, Oxides of Nitrogen, Smoke, Hydro Carbon, and Carbon monoxide emissions are decreased for all test fuels (B0, B25, B50, B75, and B100) when compared with that of the conventional engine. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The rapid depletion of fossil fuels and ever-increasing environmental pollution have forced humankind to look for a renewable energy source. Microalgae, a renewable biomass source, has been proposed as a promising feedstock to generate biofuels due to their fast growth rate with high lipid content. However, literatures have indicated that sustainable production of microalgae biofuels are only viable with a highly optimized production system. In the present study, a cradle-to-gate approach was used to provide expedient insights on the effect of different cultivation systems and biomass productivity toward life cycle energy (LCEA), carbon balance (LCCO2) and economic (LCC) of microalgae biodiesel production pathways. In addition, a co-production of bioethanol from microalgae residue was proposed in order to improve the economic sustainability of the overall system. The results attained in the present work indicated that traditional microalgae biofuels processing pathways resulted to several shortcomings, such as dehydration and lipid extraction of microalgae biomass required high energy input and contributed nearly 21 to 30% and 39 to 57% of the total energy requirement, respectively. Besides, the microalgae biofuels production system also required a high capital investment, which accounted for 47 to 86% of total production costs that subsequently resulted to poor techno-economic performances. Moreover, current analysis of environmental aspects of microalgae biorefinery had revealed negative CO2 balance in producing microalgae biofuels. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Diffusion of the biofuels (BF) using is justified by opening up the opportunities for obtaining fuel and energy from previously inaccessible sources and by the existence of energy-deficient regions, in particular in Russia. Works of different scientists on the problems of creating and using BF were the methodological basis of this study. Information on the state and prospects of the development of renewable energy sources in Russian regions was collected from regulatory documents and was obtained by employing a questionnaire survey. For the study of the collected materials, the different methods of comparative analysis, and the methods of expert assessments were used. The results of the Status-Quo analysis of BF production in Russia have shown that the creation of BF performed relatively successfully. However, there are many more perspectives, connected with expanding the utilization of the different raw materials. Also, the analysis of organizational and economic mechanisms applied for production of BF and the obtained data on several organizations-producers allowed for proposing six indexes for the assessment of the BF production effectiveness. It is suggested that BF production in Russia will contribute to the sustainable development of a number of the country's regions in the near future. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - This study purposed to characterize the sewage sludge from various sewage treatment plants (STPs) as a biodiesel feedstock. Crude biodiesel was produced from each dried primary sludge (PS) and waste activated sludge (WAS) via in situ transesterification process. The average yield of transesterifiable lipid (TL) was 77.8% and 60.4% of the total lipid content from PS andWAS, respectively. The TL yield had a greater margin amongWAS than PS samples due to differences in the biological processes adopted in each treatment plant. The TL recovered from PS and WAS contained 54.2% and 40.1% fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), respectively, which were mostly made up of palmitic acid (C16:0) and stearic acid (C18:0). The FAME composition of the biodiesel in the WAS sample was highly associated with a microbial community that grows otherwise, depending on the purpose of the biological treatment process. In particular, the increase in the proportion of nitrifying bacteria that grow predominantly under a relatively longer solid retention time (SRT) contributed significantly to the improvement in FAME content. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Food and market waste (FMW) is one of the most abundant unrecycled products which poses waste management issues and negative environmental impacts. Thermo-catalytic reforming (TCR) is a pyrolysis based technology which can convert a wide range of biomass wastes into energy vectors bio-oil, syngas, and char. This paper investigates the conversion potential of FMW into sustainable biofuels. The FMW was processed using a laboratory scale 2 kg/h TCR reactor. The process produced 7 wt % organic bio-oil, 53 wt % permanent gas, and 22 wt % char. The bio-oil higher heating value (HHV) was found to be 36.72 MJ/kg, comparable to biodiesel, and contained a low oxygen content (&lt;5%) due to cracking of higher molecular weight organics. Naphthalene was detected to be the most abundant aromatic compound within the oil, with relative abundance of 12.95% measured by GC-MS. The total acid number of the oil (TAN) and viscosity were 11.7 mg KOH/g and 6.3 cSt, respectively. The gross calorific value of the produced biochar was 23.64 MJ/kg, while the permanent gas showed a higher heating value of approximately 17 MJ/Nm3. Methane (CH4) was found to be the largest fraction in the permanent gases reaching over 23%. This resulted either due to the partial methanation of biosyngas over the catalytically active FMW biochar or the hydrogenation of coke deposited on the biochar in the post reforming stage.

AB  - In a previous study, crude bio-oil (CBO) was obtained from fast pyrolysis of waste cooking oil (WCO) under different conditions, varying the temperature and the residence time of the process. The samples produced were characterized by physicochemical methods, and the results showed an acidic, viscous, and odoriferous material. In this study, the esterification reaction was used to reduce the acidity of CBO. This step decreased the acidity value of the bio-oil by almost 95%. Afterward, the CBO was then distilled at the boiling points of gasoline and diesel, producing light and heavy fractions with approximately 30 and 50% yields, respectively. The physicochemical characterization of these light and heavy fractions was performed to obtain information on their properties, such as the specific gravity, iodine value, kinematic viscosity, and acid number. These biofuels were also submitted to chromatographic analysis (gas chromatography with flame ionization detection and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry), which partially revealed their composition as being rich in aromatics, olefin and paraffin hydrocarbons. This study contributes to a better understanding of the characteristics of bio-oil obtained from triacylglycerols and provides data that will be useful in future studies on the pyrolysis process.

AB  - Camphorene was synthesized by the thermal Diels-Alder cyclodimerization of myrcene and subsequently hydrogenated to produce camphorane. On the basis of common fuel metrics (density, lower heating value, cetane, and viscosity) the prepared camphorane fuel displays appropriate physicochemical properties for its implementation in compression ignition engines. The high viscosity of camphorane necessitates its blending with petroleum diesel, which provides a final fuel within the ASTM specification for diesel. Soot production measurements of camphorane and its blends with diesel demonstrate a potential to significantly reduce soot emissions. The physicochemical and combustion properties of camphorane are further compared to those of other terpene biofuels along with biodiesel. Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - There are different technologies for biodiesel production, each having its benefits and drawbacks depending on the type of feedstock and catalyst used. In this study, the techno-economic performances of four catalyst technologies were investigated. The catalysts were bulk calcium oxide (CaO), enzyme, nano-calcium oxide, and ionic liquid. The study was mainly based on process simulations designed using Aspen Plus and SuperPro software. The quantity and quality of biodiesel and glycerol, as well as the amount of biodiesel per amount of feedstock, were the parameters to evaluate technical performances. The parameters for economic performances were total investment cost, unit production cost, net present value (NPV), internal return rate (IRR), and return over investment (ROI). Technically, all the studied options provided fuel quality biodiesel and high purity glycerol. However, under the assumed market scenario, the process using bulk CaO catalyst was more economically feasible and tolerable to the change in market values of major inputs and outputs. On the contrary, the enzyme catalyst option was very expensive and economically infeasible for all considered ranges of cost of feedstock and product. The result of this study could be used as a basis to do detail estimates for the practical implementation of the efficient process. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Black soldier fly larvae containing high lipids had been considered an novel sustainable feedstock for lipid extraction to biofuels. The insect lipid was extracted with microwave assisted solvent extraction method. The energy consumption of this way was analyzed to determine the feasibility of the lipid extraction process. The comparison of the effects of different extraction conditions (dehydration methods, water content, extraction temperature, extraction time, equipment power, and solute-solvent ratio) on the energy consumption of lipid extraction from the energy insect was investigated systematically. The dewatering of the insect biomass was the most energy consuming step via a dry extraction method in this paper, constituting about 40–80% of the total energy consumption demand. Within the ranges of extraction factors values compared in this analysis, the microwave radiation powder and lipid extraction temperature had a pronounced effect on the total energy consumption in the ranges of investigated parameter. At last, the lipid extraction yield-dependent evolution of energy consumption for different extraction conditions was also investigated. Anyway, the economic and environmental aspects of lipid extraction from the energy insect needed to be further improved for its large scale implementation in the future. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Vegetable oil based fuels are promising substitutes for diesel fuel for transport and industrial applications. Converting raw vegetable oils into their ethyl or methyl esters has reasonably solved the problems associated with their high viscosities. The purpose of the research is to investigate experimentally the effect of injection pressure on the combustion characteristics of a biodiesel engine using cerium oxide nanoparticles as a fuel additive. Biodiesel derived from waste cooking oil mixed with mineral diesel in the proportion 20:80 is used along with cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticles as additives. The engine is run at several fuel injection pressures (180, 210 and 240 bar) and with a nanoparticle concentration of 80 ppm. The experiments demonstrate that the higher injection pressure associated with nanoparticle addition improves engine combustion characteristics, e.g., it leads to a higher peak pressure and a higher heat release rate. The best performance was observed at an injection pressure of 240 bar with a 80 ppm nanoparticle concentration. Concentrations of hydrocarbon, oxides of nitrogen and smoke decreased for higher injection pressures with nanoparticle addition. Hence an enhancement in engine performance and decrease in emissions can be achieved in a biodiesel engine by employing higher injection pressures with nanometer sized cerium oxide particles as additives. This helps in conserving the petroleum based fuels and also avoiding the emissions of contaminants to the atmosphere. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study explores the feasibility of Sr–Ce based mixed metal oxides for its performance in transesterification reaction of waste cooking oil. The catalyst synthesis was carried out through gel combustion route and was characterized through several techniques including thermal analysis (TGA-DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), attenuated total reflectance based Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), high resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM) assisted with EDX, BET specific surface area and Hammett indicator basicity. The enhanced activity of the catalyst was investigated at pH 7.0 with Sr–Ce atomic ratio of 3:1 at 900 °C of calcination temperature. Influences of various process parameters on transesterification efficiency were carefully investigated. The experimental results demonstrated that maximum transesterification efficacy of 99.5% was achieved under optimized reaction conditions with catalyst dose of 2.0 wt %, oil-to-methanol ratio 1:14, reaction time 120 min, reaction temperature 65 °C and stirring speed of 700 rpm. For better interpretation of the process, the reaction rate was computed by employing pseudo-first and pseudo-second order kinetics model at varying reaction temperature (50 °C–75 °C). The transesterification data agreed well with pseudo-first order model with highest rate constant value of 2.5 × 10−3 min−1 was evaluated at 65 °C. Activation energy and frequency of the reaction was quantified from the Arrhenius expression as 17.04 kJ/mol and 9.92 min−1, respectively. Thermodynamic analysis of the reaction system suggests that the transesterification of the waste cooking oil followed endergonic reaction pathway. Synthesis of biodiesel was ascertained from the H1-NMR and FTIR analysis of the transesterified product, further, the physicochemical properties of the biodiesel were also compared with that of diesel fuel and the resultant values were found to be within ASTM limits. Reusability study was also conducted and it indicated that the catalyst can be easily regenerated and could be effectively reused up to four runs. © 2019

AB  - The objective of this work was to compare the effect of diethyl ether (DEE) and methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) addition to biodiesel and diesel blends on diesel engine. The ethers concentration have been varied in proportion of 5% and 10% on volume basis with biodiesel by keeping the diesel concentration as 50% for all ternary blends preparation. Experimental results revealed that D50-B45-DEE5 ternary blend has shown 5.3% increase in thermal efficiency compared to other ternary blends. On the other hand, D50-B45-MTBE5 and D50-B45-DEE ternary blends have reduced CO emission by 8.1% and 14.8% respectively when compared to high speed diesel fuel. Furthermore, the D50-B40-DEE10 blend and D50-B40-MTBE10 reduce the NOx emission by 32% and 8.8% when compared to HSD at maximum load condition. Significant reduction is noted in HC emission for all ether added ternary blends than that of HSD and biodiesel fuels. However, the smoke emission is decreased marginally for D50-B45-DEE5 than that of HSD fuel. Finally, it is evident that both the DEE and MTBE could be used as viable additive with diesel or biodiesel in binary and ternary forms for diesel engine applications. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, spray characteristics of biodiesel blending with di-n-butyl ether (DBE15, DBE30) were investigated by experiment and analysis and compared with diesel. Spray characteristics parameters including spray tip penetration, spray cone angle, maximum spray width and spray tip velocity were used to compare under different injection pressures and ambient pressures. The spray images were analyzed according to light intensity level, while the gas entrainment mass and equivalent ratio were analyzed by empirical model. The results showed that the spray tip penetration of biodiesel added with DBE was reduced and the spray cone angle and maximum spray width were increased. The range of light intensity level of biodiesel was the narrowest, while the light intensity level of biodiesel-DBE blends was similar to that of diesel. Empirical models showed that biodiesel shows poor gas-fuel mixing. DBE30 had a larger gas entrainment mass and a lower equivalence ratio, similar to diesel. It was proved that the biodiesel added with DBE enhanced the gas-fuel mixing. © 2019

AB  - The increasing demand for energy and depletion of fossil fuels are drawing attention to biofuel as a replacement for petroleum diesel. Hundreds of non-edible biodiesel feedstocks are available and are derived from seeds and animal fat or tallow. However, the selection of appropriate feedstock is fraught with difficulty, as these feedstocks have not been fully evaluated for various parameters that impact upon the performance and cost of the biofuel. Various technical, environmental, economic and social factors influence biodiesel feedstocks selection process. This paper focuses on technical aspects such as physico-chemical properties and fatty acid compositions of biodiesels in the screening process. Six biodiesels, namely papaya seed oil biodiesel (PSO), stone fruit kernel oil biodiesel (SFO), jatropha oil biodiesel (JBD), rapeseed oil biodiesel (RBD), beauty leaf tree biodiesel (BLT), and waste cooking oil biodiesel (WCB) were analysed in this study. Twelve physico-chemical properties of kinematic viscosity (KV), density, higher heating value (HHV), oxidation stability (OS), acid value (AV), flash point (FP), cold filter plug point (CFPP), cetane number (CN), iodine value (IV), monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and long chain saturated factor (LCSF) were selected as criteria for ranking the above biodiesels. Three weightage (%) methods of EQUAL, CRITIC and ENTROPY were used for weight determination of criteria. Four different multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods, namely PROMETHEE Graphical Analysis for Interactive Assistance (GAIA), Weighted sum method (WSM), Weighted product method (WPM), and Technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) were used for the analysis. Properties of these biodiesels were found to be within the limits of ASTM D6751-2, EN 14214 and the Australian standard. Finally, the results show that SFO was ranked as the best performer amongst the six biodiesel feedstocks examined in this study, PSO came out as the second best, and the WCB biodiesel feedstock was identified as the worst performer. © 2019

AB  - Coffee is the second largest traded commodity after petroleum and the second most popular beverage after water. This big industry is believed to generate huge amount of waste with spent coffee grounds (SCGs) represents one of the main by-products. Recycling of such waste to fuels and value-added products through bio-refineries is a promising way to solve the problem of many countries that face daily challenges and heavy cost in waste disposal. This review aims to shadow the light on SCGs recycling potential in which over 230 published papers on SCGs recycling topic were gathered and discussed. Various opportunities to produce biofuels such as biodiesel, biogas, bioethanol, bio-oil and fuel pellets besides value-added products such as bioactive compounds, adsorbents, polymers, nanocomposites, and compost were discussed. Moreover, the potential of membrane technology related to various processes of biorefining, separation and purification in the proposed SCG-integrated biorefinery are presented. Based on the presented review, it is obvious that recycling of SCGs offers many worthwhile options to policymakers that can contribute towards huge financial saving on taxpayers of running and maintaining landfills besides saving the environment from harmful emissions. In conclusion, this review emphasizes that SCG-integrated biorefineries to produce different types of biofuels and value-added products are a very promising approach that shall be economically more scrutinized in the foreseen future. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Electrical properties have gained interest in biofuels applications due to advances in radio frequency and microwave processing and characterization of biodiesel. In those applications, sensors play a key role since the accurate measurement of electrical properties is needed. This work presents the design, construction and characterization of a broadband (1 kHz to 100 MHz) permittivity sensor for biodiesel and blends. The sensor was characterized in the temperature range from 293 K to 343 K in the full intended frequency range. The sensor is apt for industrial use, inexpensive, and easy to build and it has very low electrical losses. For low permittivity substances the measurement uncertainty is below 1%, up to 100 MHz. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Decarboxylation process of waste cooking oils (WCOs) has been convinced to be one of the most effective methods to produce biofuels from biomass, but the high yield of correlative decarboxylation reactions used to occur under high temperature and pressure. Now, the moderate photo-decarboxylation was bursting tremendous potentials for solving the extreme situation problems, and the photoinduced active radicals ([rad]OH/h+) played the key roles in photo-decarboxylation process. However, the key step of [rad]OH-involved photo-decarboxylation has been still ambiguity. Here, we investigated the [rad]OH-involved decarboxylation reaction process using DMol3 module based on density functional theory, and the methyl stearate (MS) was chosen as the model reaction for further understanding the MS-decarboxylation controlling step and reaction mechanism. The calculated structures, thermodynamics and kinetics revealed that the MS-decarboxylation belonged to two-[rad]OH-induced reaction. With the first [rad]OH reaction, methyl hydrogen carbonate (HO–(C[dbnd]O)–OCH3, MHC), as the most stable intermediate, would exist when [rad]OH attacked the adjacent carbon of carbonyl site (C3) of MS. Then, the MHC reacted slowly with the second [rad]OH, as the controlling step of MS-decarboxylation processes. Our results indicated that the improved decarboxylation rate of MHC could accelerate the subsequent reactions in [rad]OH-involved decarboxylation processes. Finally, OH− attacking MS process was introduced for comparison. Our findings should provide new fundamental insights into [rad]OH action mechanism in photo-decarboxylation process for WCOs to biofuels. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The exposure to exhaust emissions from fuels as diesel and pyrolysis oil may result in adverse effects on human lungs. This study investigated the effects of exposing mice to the exhaust emissions from diesel, biodiesel or pyrolysis oil, for 1 hour/day for 3 days, on lung oxidative stress and whether selenium administration into these mice affects the oxidative stress. The levels of lung malondialdehyde and nitric oxide were increased after exposure to pyrolysis oil exhaust. The intraperitoneal injection of 1.78 μg selenium/kg body weight 15 minutes before the exposure to the pyrolysis oil exhaust (pyrolysis oil + selenium group) restored the normal levels of malondialdehyde and nitric oxide. The catalase and SOD activities were decreased in the groups of the mice exposed to the exhaust emissions from pyrolysis oil, biodiesel or diesel. Selenium pretreatment of these groups showed no significant change in the activities of both enzymes. In conclusion, the increased lung levels of malondialdehyde and nitric oxide after the exposure to the exhaust emission from pyrolysis oil were restored to normal by selenium administration. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Cellulosic biofuels produced from energy crops offer significant advantages over first generation biofuels. In order to understand and predict the sustainability performance of cellulosic biofuel development, this study builds a system dynamics model for a biofuel system producing cellulosic ethanol from switchgrass under different scenarios. The model can simulate the dynamic behaviors of the cellulosic biofuel system and quantify its environmental, economic, and social impacts. The projected results indicate that cellulosic ethanol production is economically viable based on advanced bioconversion technologies and can provide significant benefits to the environment, such as greenhouse gas reductions and water use savings. The cellulosic ethanol industry also can make significant contributions to the bioeconomy and social benefits. This study finds that the target of cellulosic biofuels (16 billion gallons by 2022) mandated by the revised Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2) program cannot be achieved within land-use change constraints, but may be achieved if there is no limitation on the conversion of pasture or cropland to energy crop land. Moreover, nitrate leaching and biodiversity change should be considered when expanding energy crops on marginal land, pasture, and cropland. This model is applicable for other complex bioenergy systems as a sustainability assessment tool and can provide comprehensive insights for stakeholders and policy makers to establish and implement favorable strategies for stimulating cellulosic biofuel development. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The environmental sustainability of biofuel production is still a debated issue in the world bio-economy development. Therefore, different researches are undergoing to evaluate the sustainability of ethanol production in different countries. This study aimed at analyzing the environmental performance of ethanol production in Ethiopia, considering energy balance and emission reduction using a life cycle assessment approach. It is also intended to identify the environmental hotspots so that possible improvement option can be devised. The life cycle assessment methodology was applied considering three alternative scenarios: 1) Base Case, which is the current situation, 2) Alternative 1, which considers the utilization of biogas from vinasse and bioslurry, and 3) Alternative 2, which includes mechanical harvesting and avoids pre-harvest cane trash burning. The results show that agricultural stage is greatly contributing to the pollutant emissions. The contribution of cane trash burning was significant to all the impact categories considered and avoiding pre-harvest cane trash burning significantly reduced the emissions contributing to global warming, acidification, stratospheric ozone depletion, ozone formation, particulate matter and eutrophication. On the other hand, the introduction of mechanical harvesting to avoid pre-harvest cane trash burning increased ecotoxicity, human toxicity and resource consumption (land, water and mineral) impacts. The net energy balance is positive for all the alternatives considered. In addition to using by-products, proper management of fuel utilization at the agricultural stage can further enhance benefits from the sector. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the price of molasses highly influences both energy ratio and greenhouse gas emissions since it completely shifts the allocation of upstream emissions from sugar to molasses. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Recent trends in bioprocessing have underlined the significance of lignocellulosic biomass conversions for biofuel production. These conversions demand at least 90% energy upgradation of cellulosic sugars to generate renewable drop-in biofuel precursors (Heff/C ~ 2). Chemical methods fail to achieve this without substantial loss of carbon; whereas, oleaginous biological systems propose a greener upgradation route by producing oil from sugars with 30% theoretical yields. However, these oleaginous systems cannot compete with the commercial volumes of vegetable oils in terms of overall oil yields and productivities. One of the significant challenges in the commercial exploitation of these microbial oils lies in the inefficient recovery of the produced oil. This issue has been addressed using highly selective oil capturing agents (OCA), which allow a concomitant microbial oil production and in situ oil recovery process. Results: Adsorbent-based oil capturing agents were employed for simultaneous in situ oil recovery in the fermentative production broths. Yarrowia lipolytica, a model oleaginous yeast, was milked incessantly for oil production over 380 h in a media comprising of glucose as a sole carbon and nutrient source. This was achieved by continuous online capture of extracellular oil from the aqueous media and also the cell surface, by fluidizing the fermentation broth over an adsorbent bed of oil capturing agents (OCA). A consistent oil yield of 0.33 g per g of glucose consumed, corresponding to theoretical oil yield over glucose, was achieved using this approach. While the incorporation of the OCA increased the oil content up to 89% with complete substrate consumptions, it also caused an overall process integration. Conclusion: The nondisruptive oil capture mediated by an OCA helped in accomplishing a trade-off between microbial oil production and its recovery. This strategy helped in realizing theoretically efficient sugar-to-oil bioconversions in a continuous production process. The process, therefore, endorses a sustainable production of molecular drop-in equivalents through oleaginous yeasts, representing as an absolute microbial oil factory. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Vateria indica Linn seeds were found to contain nearly 19% of oil/fat content. This fat is converted into biodiesel by a novel method by the authors at the biodiesel preparation facility at NITK, Surathkal, India. As biodiesel is a promising alternative fuel for petro diesel in compression ignition (CI) engines, this biofuel is tested in a single-cylinder diesel engine. The objective of this work is to find combustion, performance and emission characteristics of a CI engine with diesel and blends of V. indica biodiesel at 180, 200 and 220 bar injection pressures. Blending is done in volumetric ratios of 10%, 15%, 20% and 25% of biodiesel with diesel which are called as B10, B15, B20 and B25. The idea of increasing fuel injection pressure is to promote atomisation and full penetration into the combustion chamber leading to better combustion. Blend B25 showed best thermal efficiency of the order of 33.03% and the least NOX emission of 1047 ppm at 220 bar injection pressure at 75% load. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The introduction of EU mandates for biofuel use in the transport sector initially led to high expectations that African countries would benefit from biofuel exports to the EU. This market opportunity has not been realised, however, due to regulatory requirements for the production of biofuels that act as non-tariff barriers to the acceptance of African biofuels in the EU. This benefits producers of biofuel crops and processors in the EU by providing economic protection. In particular, the EU import regime fails to acknowledge the challenges faced by African (or other) developing countries in satisfying the requirements. Using a computable general equilibrium model for Malawi, we quantify the foregone potential benefits from biofuel production for exports to the EU arising from non-tariff barriers (NTBs) embedded in the sustainability criteria. Our results show that sugarcane-ethanol production under smallholder outgrower regimes would lead to both economic growth outcomes and rural development, whereas jatropha-biodiesel fails to increase rural incomes due to low profitability. While there is widespread agreement on the latter today, our study is the first to explore the failure of jatropha in Malawi in an economy-wide framework. The ethanol results, however, also hold if land clearing is forbidden, thereby preserving biodiversity as stipulated under the sustainability criteria in the EU Renewable Energy Directive. The EU NTBs embedded in the Renewable Energy Directive thus play a much larger role for countries in Sub-Sahara Africa than simply inhibiting investment opportunities and should be refashioned to lower the entry costs for developing countries. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - This bibliographic review gives a concise overview of cultivation of microalgae for the production of biofuel. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is one of the best microalgae that can be used for producing biofuel because of its simplicity of genome that allows it to be easily manipulated by genetic engineering for abundant growth. C. reinhardtii produces lipids under nitrogen deficient condition, which contains many triacylglycerols (TAGs) that influences the metabolism to a great extent and used for membrane remodeling. Several genes such as citrate synthase and DGAT2 involved in this mechanism were manipulated by engineering metabolic pathways to maximize lipid production under nitrogen deprived conditions. Additionally, C. reinhardtii can be efficiently cultivated and grown in closed photobioreactors, flat plate, tubular or vertical column with protected CO2 rather than open pond systems. In addition, C. reinhardtii can be harvested by several methods including Tris-Acetate Phosphate Pluronic (TAPP) medium method. Compared to conventional diesel, microalgae based biofuel, which is produced by trans-esterfication reactions, has a higher pour point temperature but similar properties. Contrasting Energy-efficiency ratio (EER) values of C. reinhardtii with those of other crops (Jatropha, palm oil and sunflower) is a crucial process before commercialization. The environmental impacts of microalgae are also beneficial in a way it can treat wastewater containing large amounts of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, which are beneficial for algae cultivation and produce bio-oil. However, this is a risky proposition as it can cause eutrophication and hypoxia in the ponds. Nevertheless, further research on bio-fuel production from C. reinhardtii must be carried out. © 2019.

AB  - The present study investigates the effects of alternative fuel properties on combustion performance, in order to ensure reliable combustion performance using various fuel blends for powering an engine. The increasing rate of fuel cost and depletion of fossil fuels has led to the search for alternate fuels. Palm biodiesel derived from palm fatty acids meets the fuel requirements of an aircraft and is compatible with any engine without modifications. Viability of using a blend of present fossil fuels with biodiesel is studied. The engine was operated with petrol, diesel, palm biodiesel and a blend of these three fuels as a pair, with various ratios. The fuel was injected into the combustion chamber at an angle of 45o to the airflow and ignited using a spark plug. The blended fuel is found to have better efficiency than petrol or diesel. Furthermore, the low cost and abundant availability of the biofuel make it a viable alternative to the petroleum-based fuels currently in use. The combustion time and ignition delay are decreased with efficient biofuel due to high oxygen content and high octane number of the biofuel. © 2019. Published by INCAS.

AB  - The objective of this study is to identify Mexican nontoxic ecotypes of Jatropha curcas with potential for a sustainable agriculture practice to produce biodiesel and food products through a methodology and criteria of sustainability. In a rural region of Morelos state in central México, nine Mexican ecotypes of Jatropha curcas were evaluated in an experimental plantation with minimal water resources and fertilization. The experimental trial was assessed in terms of (1) toxicity, (2) growth and survival of the plants, (3) yield of seed, (4) residual biomass production, (5) oil characteristics for biodiesel production, (6) nutrimental properties of the seeds, and (7) changes in the chemical properties of the soil. Finally, two outstanding nontoxic ecotypes were identified as the most suitable for the establishment of Jatropha curcas crops to produce biodiesel and, at the same time, for food products using the de-oiled endosperm cake, for energy production from the residual biomass and for improvement of soil properties in marginal lands of rural regions of Morelos state. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The current study evaluates the technical and economic viability of a project for off-grid power generation using renewable resources, by upgrading an existing system of a diesel generator powered by mixtures of Jatropha biofuel with diesel for electricity generation to rural inhabitants in Mozambique. The investment on the current system was 290645.00MZN ($5363) included in a system of extraction and oil degumming of Jatropha curcas L., which was used to charge a set of 23 lead-acid batteries (12V, 50Ah) rented to the population. However, the uptake of this solution by the population was lower than expected (10 batteries rented per day in average). In the current study, it is considered that the power of the energy required daily to load 20 batteries is supplied by additional renewable energy resources, like PV and micro-wind turbines, in order to improve the economic feasibility of the system for the population. The results show that the system upgrade with PV panels, or PV panels and a wind turbine has technical advantages over the current system and lower costs, which suggest that upgrading the current system with renewable energy generation would improve the usability of the system. © 2019 Pushpa Publishing House, Prayagraj, India.

AB  - Pyrolysis bio-oils contain significant amounts of carboxylic acids which limit their utility as biofuels. Ketonisation of carboxylic acids within biomass pyrolysis vapours is a potential route to upgrade the energy content and stability of the resulting bio-oil condensate, but requires active, selective and coke-resistant solid acid catalysts. Here we explore the vapour phase ketonisation of acetic acid over Ga-doped HZSM-5. Weak Lewis acid sites were identified as the active species responsible for acetic acid ketonisation to acetone at 350◦C and 400◦C. Turnover frequencies were proportional to Ga loading, reaching ~6 min−1 at 400◦C for 10Ga/HZSM-5. Selectivity to the desired acetone product correlated with the weak:strong acid site ratio, being favoured over weak Lewis acid sites and reaching 30% for 10Ga/HZSM-5. Strong Brønsted acidity promoted competing unselective reactions and carbon laydown. 10Ga/HZSM-5 exhibited good stability for over 5 h on-stream acetic acid ketonisation. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Low carbon emission has a major positive impact on our society. Due to the importance of reducing carbon emission levels, factors that contribute significantly towards reducing carbon emission levels have attracted the interest of academics and researchers in the field. In this paper, the author develops a multiple linear regression analysis to examine the relationship between renewable energy consumption, biofuel production, resources productivity, bioenergy productivity, the level of urbanization and population and their impact on total carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Data was collected from the European Statistical Office (EUROSTAT) and four statistical hypotheses were validated through a regression model with panel data using the statistical software EViews 11. The study was conducted for 27 European Union (EU) countries during 2008 to 2017. The author's findings indicate that renewables have a direct and positive influence on the levels of CO2 emissions, as opposed to population growth and urbanization. These findings suggest that public policy should be directed towards increasing the use of renewables in EU countries, while the level of urbanization and the population growth add more restrictions in the modelling equation of the impact on CO2 emissions. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Diesel cycle engines are widely used in agricultural machinery. Biodiesel offers the possibility of partial or total replacement of mineral diesel, thus reducing the dependence of agriculture on this nonrenewable resource and decreasing pollutant emissions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the emissions of CO, NOx, SO2, CO2, and O2 from various biodiesel mixtures (B0 = 0%, B7 = 7%, B10 = 10%, B20 = 20%, B30 = 30% and B100 = 100%) in a single-cylinder tractor engine at 1000, 1600 and 2400 rpm. The exhaust gases were identified using a gas probe meter. Fuels with a higher percentage of biodiesel have the lowest SO2 emissions, with the B30 mixture releasing 65.78, 52.47 and 32.25 parts per million at 1000, 1600 and 2000 rpm, respectively. Nitrous oxides and carbon dioxide emissions decreases with higher engine rotation speed. Higher percentages of biodiesel result in less polluting fuels. © 2019, Departamento de Engenharia Agricola - UFCG/Cnpq. All rights reserved.

AB  - Limited alternative fuels for a CO2-neutral aviation sector have already been ASTM certified; synthetic paraffinic kerosene from hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA-SPK) is one of these-a sustainable aviation fuel. With the hypothesis to improve the greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of a HEFA plant by realizing the required hydrogen supply via electrolysis-power to gas (PTG)-an exemplary SynBioPTx approach is investigated in a comprehensive feasibility study, which is, regarding this comparatively new approach, a novelty in its extent. About 10 scenarios are analysed by technical, environmental, and economic aspects. Within the alternative scenarios on feedstocks, electricity supply, necessary hydrogen supply, and different main products are analysed. For different plant designs of the hybrid refinery, mass and energy balances are elaborated, along with the results of the technical assessment. As a result of this environmental assessment, the attainment of at least 50% GHG mitigation might be possible. GHG highly depends on the renewability grade of the hydrogen provision as well as on the used feedstock. One important conclusion of this economic assessment is that total fuel production costs of 1295 to 1800 EUR t-1 are much higher than current market prices for jet fuel. The scenario in which hydrogen is produced by steam reforming of internally produced naphtha proves to be the best combination of highly reduced GHG emissions and low HEFA-SPK production costs. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Aviation industry has the challenge of halving CO2 emissions by 2050, as compared to 2005. An alternative are drop-in biofuels, which are sustainable and fully compatible with aircraft engines and also can be mixed with fossil jet fuel. Among the feedstock for biojet fuel production, licuri (Syagrus coronata) can be highlighted as most of its fatty acids are in the jet fuel range. Thereby, this work investigated the composition and physicochemical characterization of licuri oil and licuri biodiesel, both with satisfactory results according to international standards, with the purpose of obtaining hydrocarbons in the range of jet fuel from these feedstock, by catalytic deoxygenation. The semi-batch reaction, using a 5% Pd/C catalyst at 300 °C and 207 psi, produced n-alkanes with a conversion of up to 39.2%. The n-alkane selectivity was 80.7%, in addition to CO2 selectivity of 83.4% for biodiesel, indicating the preference for the decarboxylation pathway and also confirming licuri as a potential raw material for biojet fuel. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - As global biodiesel production increases, there are concerns over the potential health impact of exposure to the exhaust, particularly in regard to young children who are at high risk because of their continuing lung development. Using human airway epithelial cells obtained from young children, we compared the effects of exposure to exhaust generated by a diesel engine with Euro V/VI emission controls running on conventional diesel (ultra-low-sulfur mineral diesel, ULSD), soy biodiesel (B100), or a 20% blend of soy biodiesel with diesel (B20). The exhaust output of biodiesel was found to contain significantly more respiratory irritants, including NOx, CO, and CO2, and a larger overall particle mass. Exposure to biodiesel exhaust resulted in significantly greater cell death and a greater release of immune mediators compared to both air controls and ULSD exhaust. These results have concerning implications for potential global health impacts, particularly for the pediatric population. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - La-Fe modified Si-MCM-41 (La-Fe/Si-MCM-41) catalysts were prepared by the wet impregnation method and used in catalytic cracking of soybean oil (CCS) for biofuel production. The catalysts were characterized by BET, XRD, XPS, Py-FTIR and CO2-TPD. The results showed that the aromatics content increased with the increase in B/L value, while the content of oxygenated compounds decreased, indicating that Brönsted acid sites were the major active sites for deoxygenation and aromatization reactions. Compared with Si-MCM-41, the Brönsted acidity of LFM-6 sharply decreased from 22.49 to 5.86 μmol g−1. Accordingly, the aromatics content was reduced from 37.51 wt.% to 14.52 wt.% which was lower than the limitation (15 wt.%) according to the global environmental legislation. However, for the LFM-6 catalyst, the excessive loss of Brönsted acid sites and sharp decrease in BET surface area and pore volume led to the decrease in deoxygenation. As a result, the fatty acids content increased from 2.71 wt.% to 16.67 wt.% and the acid value reached 35.20 mgKOH g−1. When the La-Fe loading increased to 15 wt.%, part of fatty acids were converted into ketones by the active sites on Fe2O3/La2O3 and strong Lewis acid sites on catalysts. Besides, the new weak Lewis acid and basic sites on Fe2O3/La2O3 exhibited the synergistic effect on promoting the generation of alkenes. The CaO/LFM-6 composite catalysts prepared by the mechanical mixing of LFM-6 and CaO were used in CCS to reduce the acid value of biofuel. LFM-6-C-3 was proved to be an effective catalyst for CCS to produce biofuel with low aromatics (12.31 wt.%) and fatty acids (2.76 wt.%) content. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Non-edible seeds are not used in any commercial applications, which implies that they can be used for biofuel applications. The present study aimed to maximise the process conditions for oil extraction and sterculia biodiesel production from Sterculia foetida (poon oil). GC-MS identified the methyl esters of sterculia oil as sterculic acid (32%), palmitic acid (15.88%), oleic acid (10.00%), linoleic acid (9.95%) and malvalic acid (9%). Response surface methodology (RSM) based parametric optimisation of oil extraction was carried out by choosing process variables such as sample weight, volume of solvent to seed ratio and time. The optimum sample amount of 7.5 g and the volume of solvent to seed ratio of 40 mL/g resulted in a maximum oil yield of 45.27% at 3 h. The results were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) with a regression coefficient (R2) of 0.9988. Furthermore, the artificial neural network (ANN) resulted in an R2 value greater than 0.9, which validates the RSM. Conventional optimisation of the temperature (55 °C), feedstock to methanol ratio (1:12), catalyst proportion (1.5%) and transesterification reaction time (60 min) yield 90.87% biodiesel production. The physicochemical characteristics of oil and biodiesel complied with the requirements of the ASTM standards. The rate constant and thermodynamic variables at the optimum temperature (333 K) were calculated from the experimental data. The activation energy (Ea), activation enthalpy in transition state theory (ΔH++), activation entropy in transition state theory (ΔS++) and Gibbs free energy in transition state theory (ΔG++) were 37.91 kJ mol−1, 35.14 kJ mol−1, − 239.58 J mol−1 K−1 and 79.81 kJ mol−1 respectively.

AB  - In the present work, an experimental investigation was conducted to study the influence of adding aluminum oxide nanoparticles (Al2O3) with different average particle sizes as additive to blends of diesel and waste plastic oil (WPO) on performance, emission, and combustion attributes of single-cylinder diesel engine operated at a constant speed. Two samples of Al2O3 nanoparticle with average particle sizes of 20 and 100 nm were dispersed into a WPO20 blend containing 20% of WPO and 80% of diesel in the mass fractions of 10 and 20 ppm using ultrasonic stabilization. The experimental recordings revealed a decrease in engine performance and increase in all emission constituents while replacing diesel with WPO20. However, the addition of both 20- and 100-nm-sized Al2O3 nanoparticles into WPO20 was found to enhance the brake thermal efficiency (BTHE) by 12.2 and 8.9% respectively and decrease the brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) by 11 and 8% respectively. The emission constituents such as carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), nitric oxide (NO), and smoke opacity were minimized by the addition of both 20- and 100-nm-sized nanoparticles into WPO20 blend. However, the reduction of emissions was better for 20-nm-sized particles compared with that of 100-nm-sized particles. The combustion attributes such as cylinder pressure, heat release rate (HRR), and rate of pressure rise (RPR) were raised with shortened ignition delay (ID) by the addition of both sized nanoparticles. Overall, the inclusion of 20-nm-sized nanoparticles performs better catalytic activity to enhance the engine output characteristics along with minimum exhaust emissions. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Woody biomass has a considerable potential for energy purposes specially after densification processes which convert these materials into solid biofuels with higher energy density. This study focuses on the energy and environmental assessment of pellet production system from vine and olive grove woody biomass. The life cycle assessment (LCA) from grape and olive cultivation up to packed pellet production, ready for delivery to final users was conducted to quantify the eco-profile of agro-pellet production. The results of comparative analysis revealed that pellet production from both biomasses is dominated by cultivation phase. Vine pellet production was more dependent on chemical fertilizers specially potassium sulfate, but olive pellet production was more dependent on copper oxide pesticide. Primary energy use per MJ energy of vine pellet was greater than that of olive pellet (0.6 vs. 0.19). On the other hand, energy return ratio of olive pellet was three times of that of vine pellet (5.22 vs. 1.7). Nevertheless, olive pellet had higher environmental impacts in the forms of human toxicity, freshwater ecotoxicity and marine ecotoxicity. Consequently, sensitivity analysis investigates the impact of variation in input parameters of fertilizers, pesticides, machinery, diesel fuel, transport and pelletizing process on LCA results. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Application of biodiesel synthesized from waste-based raw materials with numerous solvents (higher chain alcohols) in diesel engines is a topic of great interest. This article examines the effect of biodiesel–diesel–propanol ternary blends. Physio-chemical properties, fatty acids composition (FAC), FT–IR, TGA, DSC, NMR along with some selected engine and emissions performance parameters were examined. Biodiesel was produced from waste cooking oil and exhibits excellent FAC that yields kinematic viscosity, cetane number, oxidation stability, higher heating value and iodine value of 3.93 mm2/s, 58.88, 7.43 h, 39.45 MJ/kg and 64.92 g/100 g. Propanol blended biodiesel depicted an affirmative improvement in cold flow properties and decremented density. FT–IR and NMR results confirms the existence of biodiesel–diesel–propanol and prove their qualities as reliable methods. DSC and TGA results confirm that propanol reduces the onset and crystallization temperatures of the blends. Engine and emissions performance revealed that propanol addition further increased brake specific energy consumption (BSEC) and brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and reduced carbon monoxide (CO), exhaust gas temperature (EGT), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and smoke. This study proves the feasibility of the ternary blends with rewarding benefits in cold flow properties and densities besides acceptable engine and emissions performance results. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work presents an analysis of a diesel power generator converted to operate in Otto cycle using ethanol as fuel. This conversion was done without changing the compression ratio of 17:1, with the build-up of adequate control for intake air mass flow rate, fuel injection, and ignition timing when operating with ethanol. The new conversion approach allows for simplicity of reversion to the original configuration. In Diesel cycle, the engine was fuelled with diesel oil containing 7% biodiesel injected directly into the combustion chamber. The in-cylinder pressure, emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOX), unburned hydrocarbons (THC), as well as fuel conversion efficiency, when operating with pure hydrous ethanol, were evaluated. The results showed no significant changes on THC emissions in Otto cycle configuration, in comparison with engine operation in Diesel cycle configuration. The emissions of CO2, CO, and NOX were increased when operating in Otto cycle with ethanol. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate the energy recovery through biodiesel and bioethanol production from Scenedesmus obliquus in a sequential route of lipid extraction followed by fermentation, with recycling of waste glycerol (WG) as a nutrient supplement into the culture. Low WG concentrations significantly enhanced the cellular dry weight over the control, recording the maximum significant value of 3.63 g L−1 using 2.5 g L−1 of WG (WG2.5). In addition, the maximum carbohydrate and lipid contents were recorded in WG2.5, which represented 16.4% and 21.7%, respectively, over the corresponding control, with simultaneous reduction in protein content. Moreover, total fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) recovery from biomass increased after WG2.5 supplementation, recording an increase of 24.6% over the control. Fermentation of lipid-free biomass increased the rate of bioethanol production, reaching its peak of 4.82 g L−1 at the 27th day. However, using of WG2.5 for microalgal growth and the residual lipid-free biomass for fermentation showed the highest bioethanol production peak of 5.58 g L−1 at day 27. Due to the accumulation of carbohydrates under WG, the biomass treated with WG2.5 showed increase in maximum bioethanol productivity up to 0.185 g L−1 h−1. However, sequential fermentation after lipid extraction enhanced the maximum bioethanol productivity by 32.3% and 15.1% over the whole cells from synthetic wastewater (WW) and lipid-free biomass from WW, respectively. The highest gross energy output of 21.4 GJ ton−1 dry microalgae was estimated from the integrated route where S. obliquus was grown in WG-enriched medium and sequential fermentation was applied for the residual biomass after lipid extraction, with the highest recorded energy conversion efficiency of 62.9%. These findings provide an innovative practical integrated approach for waste recycling and high conversion efficiency of microalgal biomass for liquid biofuel production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The use of alternative fuels or biofuel blends could be a way to reduce the environmental burden of increasing traffic. The aim of this study was to compare emissions from conventional fuels and alternative biofuels for diesel and spark-ignition engines under comparable conditions, i.e., using the World Harmonized Transient Cycle for a heavy-duty diesel engine and the Artemis CADC driving cycle for automobiles powered by gasoline and alternative fuels. Total contents of Ba, Ce, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn were determined in emissions, fuels, and lubricating oils. In addition, the bioaccessibility of metals in emissions was also assessed by extraction in water and in simulated lung fluid (Gamble’s solution). Total particulate mass emissions, expressed per kilogram of fuel, and total contents of metals were higher for the diesel engine than for spark-ignition engines. The highest metal contents in emissions from diesel and gasoline fuels were found for Fe, Zn, and Cu. Fe and Cu in emissions from diesel and spark-ignition engines declined with the addition of bio-components in fuels. However, there was no significant decrease in the contents of other metals in emissions from biofuels. The highest degrees of bioaccessibility were observed for Ba, Zn, Cd, and V in emissions from diesel and biodiesel (according to their solubility in water). On the basis of this study, the use of biodiesel (especially methylesters of rapeseed oil) can be recommended to reduce the total mass of particulate and metal emissions from diesel engines. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Abstract: Lignocellulosic biomass-derived bio-oil is considered as a promising renewable biofuel. In this paper, incipient wetness impregnation method, ammonia grafting method and direct synthesis method were employed as nickel loading methods for the preparation of Ni/Al-SBA-15 catalysts. The effects of these nickel loading approaches on the structure and hydrodeoxygenation performance of Ni/Al-SBA-15 were studied. The structure of Ni/Al-SBA-15 was significantly influenced by the nickel loading methods, including the specific surface area, the pore volume, the wall thickness and so on. Nickel loading methods also affected the actual nickel content of nickel-based catalysts. Unsuccessful loading of nickel species was observed during the preparation of Ni/Al-SBA-15 using direct synthesis method. The conversion of eugenol and selectivity of products after hydrodeoxygenation in n-dodecane over Ni/Al-SBA-15 catalysts were investigated. Results showed that the conversion of eugenol nearly reached 100% for all the reaction, but the composition of product was significantly different when using different Ni/Al-SBA-15 as hydrodeoxygenation catalyst. The reaction pathway of eugenol hydrodeoxygenation in n-dodecane was also speculated in this paper. Graphic Abstract: Effects of nickel loading approaches on the structure and hydrodeoxygenation performance of Ni/Al-SBA-15 were investigated. For the liquid phase hydrodeoxygenation of eugenol to hydrocarbon, catalysts prepared by ammonia grafting method exhibited the highest catalytic activity.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The oxidation of a Jatropha curcas-derived biodiesel was accelerated through the Rancimat method. High-frequency reciprocating friction, wear testing and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC–MS) were utilized to analyze the influence of composition changes during the oxidation of Jatropha biodiesel on its lubricating properties. This research indicated that: The polar functional ester group of Jatropha biodiesel could be adsorbed on a metal surface to form a physical adsorption membrane, while its carbon‑carbon double bond would enhance the electrostatic force among the adsorbed membrane molecules, to improve the lubricating properties of Jatropha biodiesel; the oxidation had a significant effect on the lubricating properties of biodiesel. The peroxides generated by the short-time oxidation would stimulate the decomposition of the fatty acid chain, destroying the stability of the lubricative adsorption membrane. The highly polar products and epoxy compounds formed at the later stage of oxidation contributed to the formation of a stable boundary film on the metal surface and enhanced the lubricity of biodiesel. © 2019

AB  - To seek a way to valorize sewage sludge (SS), it was chosen as a raw material for biodiesel production. As such, non-catalytic transesterification of dried SS was carried out, to enhance its value. Note that picking a waste material such as SS as an inexpensive lipid feedstock for biodiesel production, without lipid extraction, greatly increases the economic viability of biodiesel. Also, to enhance biodiesel sustainability, ethanol (EtOH) was employed as the acyl acceptor, in this study, and this was experimentally justified by results showing that employing EtOH as an acyl acceptor provided an effective means for compensating for the lower heating value arising from the large amount of palmitic (C16) acid in SS. This study experimentally proved that the fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) yield at 380 °C reached up to 13.33 wt% of dried SS. Given that the lipid content of dried SS is 14.01 ± 0.64 wt%, the FAEE yield of 13.33 wt% implied that 95.14 wt% of lipid in dried SS had been converted into FAEEs. The introduced SS valorization in this study offered an excellent opportunity to address diverse environmental hazards arising from SS and associated emerging contaminants. Given that the optimal temperature for the non-catalytic conversion for biodiesel production from SS was found to be 380 °C, emerging contaminants, such as microplastics and antimicrobials, were simultaneously degraded, due to their inferior thermal stabilities. Lastly, considering that the introduced biodiesel conversion process is thermally induced, the SS reside after the biodiesel conversion process can be further used in thermo-chemical processes as raw materials for gasification and pyrolysis (future work). © 2019

AB  - Many cities fail to meet air quality standards, which results in increased risk for pulmonary disorders, including asthma. Human and experimental studies have shown that diesel exhaust (DE) particles are associated with worsening of allergic asthma. Biodiesel (BD), a cleaner fuel from renewable sources, was introduced in the eighties. Because of the reduction in particulate matter (PM) emissions, BD was expected to cause fewer adverse pulmonary effects. However, only limited data on the effect of BD emissions in asthma are available. Objective: Determine whether BD exhaust exposure in allergic sensitized mice leads to different effects on inflammatory and functional responses compared to DE exposure. Methods: Balb/C mice were orotracheally sensitized with House Dust Mite (HDM) or a saline solution with 3 weekly instillations. From day 9 until day 17 after sensitization, they were exposed daily to filtered air (FA), DE and BD exhaust (concentration: 600 μg/m3 PM2.5). Lung function, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cell counts, cytokine levels (IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-17, TNF-α, TSLP) in the BALF, peribronchiolar eosinophils and parenchymal macrophages were measured. Results: HDM-sensitized animals presented increased lung elastance (p = 0.046), IgG1 serum levels (p = 0.029), peribronchiolar eosinophils (p = 0.028), BALF levels of total cells (p = 0.020), eosinophils (p = 0.028), IL-5 levels (p = 0.002) and TSLP levels (p = 0.046) in BALF. DE exposure alone increased lung elastance (p = 0.000) and BALF IL-4 levels (p = 0.045), whereas BD exposure alone increased BALF TSLP levels (p = 0.004). BD exposure did not influence any parameters after HDM challenge, while DE exposed animals presented increased BALF levels of total cells (p = 0.019), lymphocytes (p = 0.000), neutrophils (p = 0.040), macrophages (p = 0.034), BALF IL-4 levels (p = 0.028), and macrophagic inflammation in the lung tissue (p = 0.037), as well as decreased IgG1 (p = 0.046) and IgG2 (p = 0.043) levels when compared to the HDM group. Conclusion: The results indicate more adverse pulmonary effects of DE compared to BD exposure in allergic sensitized animals. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - On December 31, 2002, the Shatabdi Express, one of the top trains in India, ran from Amritsar to New Delhi using fuel blended with Jatropha curcas L. (Jatropha) seed oil. After this, very ambitious goals were set by India in 2003 to blend 20% Jatropha seed oil and ethanol in diesel and petrol by 2017, respectively, and this was expected to reach 30% by the end of 2020. During the last decade, India has undertaken various programs like Ethanol Blended Petrol Program, National Biodiesel Mission, Biodiesel Blending Program, etc., to promote the use of biofuels. Currently, the blending of ethanol in petrol and biodiesel in diesel is only about 2 and 0.1%, respectively. On June 4, 2018, India has revamped its National Policy on Biofuels, with few modifications in earlier bioenergy policies and almost same target of 20% blending of ethanol in petrol and 5% biodiesel oil in diesel by 2030. Within 3 months of release of this policy, Jatropha biodiesel has energized Indian aviation to fly its first biofuel-based flight to cover about 126 miles of air distance on August 27, 2018. Here, I am briefly sharing my views about the journey of bioenergy globally and mindset of Indian policy makers regarding potential developments of bioenergy in India. © 2019, The Joint Center on Global Change and Earth System Science of the University of Maryland and Beijing Normal University.

AB  - Canola (or rapeseed) oil and waste vegetable oil (WVO) are used commonly to make biodiesel fuels composed completely from these oils (B100) or as blends with petroleum diesel (B0). However, no studies have reported the mutagenic potencies of the particulate matter with diameter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5) or the mutagenicity emission factors, such as revertants/MJthermal (rev/MJth) for these biodiesel emissions. Using strains TA98 and TA100 with the Salmonella (Ames) mutagenicity assay, we determined these metrics for organic extracts of PM2.5 of emissions from biodiesel containing 5% soy oil (soy B5); 5, 20, 50, and 100% canola (canola B5, B20, B50, B100), and 100% waste vegetable oil (WVO B100). The mutagenic potencies (rev/mg PM2.5) of the canola B100 and WVO B100 emissions were generally greater than those of B0, whereas the mutagenicity emission factors (rev/MJth, rev/kg fuel, and rev/m3) were less, reflecting the lower PM emissions of the biodiesels relative to B0. Nearly all the rev/mg PM2.5 and rev/MJth values were greater in TA98 with S9 than without S9, indicating a relatively greater role for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which require S9, than nitroarenes, which do not. In TA100 -S9, the rev/mg PM2.5 and rev/MJth for the biodiesels were generally ≥ to those of B0, indicating that most of these biodiesels produced more direct-acting, base-substitution mutagenic activity than did B0. For B100 biodiesels and petroleum diesel, the rev/MJth in TA98 + S9 ranked: petroleum diesel &gt; canola &gt; WVO &gt; soy. The diesel emissions generally had rev/MJth values orders of magnitude higher than those of large utility-scale combustors (natural gas, coal, oil, or wood) but orders of magnitude lower than those of inefficient open burning (e.g., residential wood fireplaces). These comparative data of the potential health effects of a variety of biodiesel fuels will help inform the life-cycle assessment and use of biodiesel fuels. © 2019

AB  - With increasing strict environmental laws, there is a need for operators to design a benign oil-based muds (OBMs). In this study, oil extracted from non-edible sweet almond seed (SASO) was used as the continuous phase to formulate biodiesel-based drilling mud (BBDM). Different properties of the BBDM including the economic viability were evaluated and compared with those of the diesel OBM to determine the applicability of these properties for drilling fluids and their level of toxicity to the environment. The results indicate that the rheology, filtration properties, electrical stability, thermal stability and shale swelling inhibition performance of the BBDM are comparable with those of the diesel OBM. The biodiesel has a significantly higher flash point of 169 °C than the diesel with 78 °C; demonstrating that it can supply better fire safety than the diesel. The data of the toxicity test indicate SASO to be safer and less harmful compared to diesel #2 type used. After the 28-day period of biodegradation tests, the BBDM and the diesel OBM showed 83% and 25.2% aerobic biodegradation with Penicillium sp., respectively. The low branching degree and absence of aromatic compounds in the BBDM contributes for its higher biodegradation. The economic evaluation of the BBDM indicates low cost of formulation and waste management. The general outcome of the tests illustrates that SASO has the potentials of being one of the technically and environmentally feasible substitutes for the diesel OBM. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Lipid extraction from microalgae is maximized by defining the optimal operating conditions of the microwave pretreatment method. Using the experimental data, a robust model that describes the lipid extraction is generated using fuzzy logic. Then, the optimal extraction conditions of the lipid are determined using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Three different operating parameters influence on the recovered lipid from Microalgae. These parameters are power (W), heating time (min), and extraction time (h). Accordingly, during the optimization process, these parameters are used as a decision variables for PSO optimizer in order to maximize the recovered lipid that used as a cost function. The resulting plots demonstrated a well-fitting between the fuzzy model and the experimental data. Based on the built model, the optimization process achieved a significant increase in the lipid extraction by 22% compared to that obtained experimentally and using the ANOVA. © 2019

AB  - Due to lower-cost energy supplies elsewhere, Europe needs resource efficient technologies to safeguard the competitiveness of its energy-intensive industries. The technical feasibility of the CCU value chain components (carbon capture, transportation and utilization) has been widely studied in literature. However infrastructural, regulatory and business strategic issues have received less attention. A review of the relevant policies (e.g. European Emissions Trading Scheme, Renewable Fuels and Waste Directives) has been performed. Stakeholder engagement and the stakeholder influence mapping was used to examine potential climate change, circular economy, renewable energy and regional industrial development policies that can support CO2 utilization value chains. The main contribution of the paper is to outline potential benefits of policies to foster the production and uptake of CO2-derived products such as methanol, polyurethane and mineral construction aggregates. Another outcome is to illustrate the role of key policy-making stakeholders in assessing the suitability of current statutes and the impact of potential changes. An important finding was that the development of connectivity infrastructure is a key missing enabler and more attention to policy on infrastructure is required. Finally, the work examines the justification for a CO2 Utilization Directive, comparable to the Carbon Capture and Storage Directive, but considering the current complexity of the European Union (EU) policy landscape. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study reports a novel method of using algae biomass as a source of lipid and various other co-products. Solvent-based extraction techniques could yield a number of products simultaneously. Further, the study focuses on all possible characterization and utilization of the three layers obtained from chloroform-methanol extraction of lipids. The lipid from the chloroform layer was transesterified for Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) production. The fatty acid methyl esters derived by oleic acid, palmitic acid, linoleic acid and phytol were majorly analysed by GC-MS. The methanol layer was analysed with HPLC and stachyose, maltotriose, glucose, fructose, acetic acid, butyric acid, DMSO, glycerol were identified. The cell debris was further physically activated, and physiochemical properties of raw algae, residual algae and algae bio-char were compared. Spectrum peaks of FTIR study identified many alkyl‒halide stretches. Similarly, EDX analysed the presence of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, potassium, chlorine, calcium, iron, magnesium and phosphorus. The SEM reveals that residual algae was comparatively crystalline and hence could not be utilized directly as an adsorbent. Therefore, further physical treatment was applied, and methylene blue dye adsorption study was also conducted to know the time and capacity of biochar as an adsorbent. However, organic and mineral enriched biomass could be used directly as fertilizer for agricultural purposes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper builds on the disconnection between scientific evidence and policy assumptions about the temporal profile of land use change (LUC) emissions. Whereas natural scientists find evidence of a decreasing time profile of LUC emissions, European energy policy relies on a steady time profile. We investigate the consequences of using such a uniform (constant) time profile when assessing biofuel projects with cost-benefit analysis, a widespread economic tool for public project assessment. We show that the use of the uniform time profile distorts LUC emissions costs downwards (upwards) when carbon prices grow slower (faster) than the discount rate. We illustrate our results with the conversion of grassland to wheat cultivation for bioethanol production in France. Under current assumptions in public project assessment, we find a 70% overestimation of costs related to direct LUC emissions. We propose two tools to aid in decision-making and address the decision error. Finally, we provide contextual policy recommendations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Fast pyrolysis is a potential technology for converting lignocellulosic biomass into bio-oil. Nevertheless, the high amounts of acid, oxygenated compounds, and water content diminish the energy density of the bio-oil and cause it to be unsuitable for direct usage. Catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) is able to improve bio-oil properties so that downstream upgrading processes can be economically feasible. Here, calcium oxide (CaO), magnesium oxide (MgO), and zinc oxide (ZnO) were employed due to their potential in enhancing bio-oil properties. The results showed that overall, all three catalysts positively impacted the empty fruit bunch fibre-derived bio-oil properties. Among the catalysts, CaO showed the most favorable effects in terms of reducing the acidity of the bio-oil and anhydrosugar. Thermal stability of bio-oils produced in the presence of CaO was studied as well. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Catalytic hydropyrolysis of beech wood has been conducted in a fluid bed reactor at 450 °C with a sulfided CoMo catalyst followed by a fixed bed hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reactor with a sulfided NiMo catalyst at hydrogen pressures between 3.0 and 35.8 bar. Using both reactors the condensable organic yield (condensed organic and C4+ in gas) varied between 18.7 and 21.5 wt% dry ash free basis (daf) and was independent of the hydrogen pressure. At 15.9 bar hydrogen or higher the condensed organic phase was essentially oxygen free (&lt;0.01 wt% dry basis (db)), but decreasing the hydrogen pressure to 3.0 bar increased the oxygen content to 7.8 wt% db. The char and coke yield was close to constant (11.0–12.7 wt% daf) at hydrogen pressures between 15.9 and 35.8 bar, but increased to 15.7 wt% at 3.0 bar hydrogen due to an increase in the polymerization of pyrolysis vapors. The measured carbon content on the spent catalysts from both the fluid bed and HDO reactor showed that coking of the catalysts increased when the hydrogen pressure was decreased below 15.9 bar. The increased coking at low hydrogen pressure (&lt;15.9 bar) was ascribed to the polymerization of the more reactive oxygenates produced in the fluid bed reactor. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biowaste is a prominent source for second generation biofuels and other biobased products since it constitutes an abundant feedstock, the current treatment of which poses challenges to the environment. In the current paper, the environmental sustainability of a biorefinery system producing ethanol from biowaste is assessed by means of Life Cycle Assessment. It is shown that the biorefinery system presents very good environmental performance, as the net emissions are quite low for all the impact categories examined, while in many of the cases the emissions are negative. The total net global warming impact is estimated to be -15 kg CO2eq/ton biowaste. Following, the environmental impacts from biowaste treatment with the biorefinery system are compared to those from biowaste treatment with the conventional municipal waste management methods. It is shown that the biorefinery system presents very good performance compared to the current waste management methods. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is conducted for investigating the impact of increased enzyme dosage to the overall environmental performance of the system. It is found that, the increase in ethanol production due to increased enzyme dosage has a smaller impact to the system performance compared to the effect of increased enzyme dosage. Furthermore, it was shown that the range of enzyme contribution in the global warming impact of ethanol biorefineries is wide (11–62%) which is attributed to a number of parameters, such as the high variation of the reported global warming impact of enzymes, the different enzyme loadings and ethanol yields. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Fuel cells are considered one of the key technologies to reach the ambitious European goal of a low carbon economy, by reducing CO2 emissions and limiting the production of other pollutants. The manuscript presents an assessment of the life cycle energy and environmental performances of a solid oxide fuel cell system for household applications using primary data from the manufacturing phase and experimental data for the start-up and operation phases. The Life Cycle Assessment methodology is applied, based on a functional unit of 1 MJ of exergy and includes the life cycle steps from the raw materials extraction to the maintenance. The results show a particular relevance of the operation stage on the impacts (about 98% of cumulative energy demand and more than 63% of about half of the examined environmental impacts), mainly due to the fuel supply and, focusing on climate change, to the CO2 emissions during the conversion of chemical energy into electricity. Manufacturing step is the main responsible of the remaining half of the impacts, with a contribution higher than 38%, mainly imputable to the stacks production. For almost half of the examined impact, a contribution of 20–30% is caused by the maintenance step, with a relevant contribution of the stacks and DC/DC booster substitutions. The analysis highlights that eco-design solutions of the assessed system can be traced in the improvement of the energy system efficiency and reduction of emissions during the operation, and in the increase of the durability of the system components, thus reducing the number of their substitutions. The results of a sensitivity analysis on the selection of the functional unit also clarified the importance of the recovery of the thermal energy generated by the fuel cells, in order to avoid concurrent energy generation from conventional sources. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Gasoline compression ignition mode is one of the low-temperature combustion strategies using gasoline instead of diesel fuel and it is better than the other low-temperature combustion modes in terms of ignition controllability. Difficulty in the ignition at low loads and maximum pressure rise rate during high loads is the main problem in commercializing this engine. In order to solve this problem, hydrogenated catalytic biodiesel is blended with gasoline in different proportions and its combustion and emission characteristics under different working loads are investigated in a single injection mode. Stable combustion is achieved using this gasoline/hydrogenated catalytic biodiesel blends without any combustion assistance and increasing intake temperature. Results show that G70H30 blending fuel illustrates a comprehensively better combustion and emissions performance. However, the high maximum pressure rise rate at high loads and high particulate matter emission are the main problems. Hence, multiple injection strategies are applied for G70H30 to solve the above problem. It reveals that the particulate matter emission for 20% pilot injection ratio is lower than that of single injection mode. The maximum pressure rise rate of 20% or 30% pilot injection ratio can meet the engine limit. While the carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons emissions for double injection mode are higher than that of single injection mode and it increases with increasing pilot injection ratio. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Algal biofuel has been advocated as a sustainable and environmentally friendly renewable energy source. However, intensive chemical usage, high energy consumption, and high operation and maintenance costs associated with current cell disruption methods have been identified as main challenges to cost-effective production of algal biofuel. Viral infection of algae is a natural process that can lyse algal cells under ambient conditions without using chemicals or energy-intensive equipment. This study, for the first time, provides a comprehensive and in-depth evaluation of the feasibility of using viruses to assist algal lipid extraction. Detailed mechanistic studies were conducted to evaluate the impact on mechanical strength of algal cell walls, lipid yield, and lipid distribution when Chlorella sp. were infected by Paramecium bursaria Chlorella virus 1 (PBCV-1). Viral disruption with multiplicity of infection of 10−8 was able to disrupt concentrated algal biomass completely in six days. Our results indicated that viral disruption significantly reduced the mechanical strength of algal cells. Lipid yield with viral disruption increased more than three times compared to no disruption controls and was similar to that of ultrasonic disruption. Moreover, lipid composition analysis showed that the quality of extracted lipids was not affected by viral infection. The results showed that viral infection is a highly cost-effective technique to promote lipid extraction without extensive energy input and chemicals required by existing disruption methods. The results of this study provided new insights in the development of nature-inspired lipid extraction methods for cost-efficient biofuel production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work presents an economic feasibility study of using algae and biochar burial strategies to offset carbon emission from the use of conventional fossil-derived transport fuels. The economic feasibility is quantified on the basis that the final price of the decarbonised fossil-derived diesel should be lower or equal to the price of biodiesel which is deemed to be the next best alternative. The extra costs associated with the carbon capture/offset via algae and biochar burial are estimated for the most typical scenarios using the economic models developed as part of this work. In addition, High Dimensional Model Representation based global sensitivity analyses are performed in order to quantify the influence of key model parameters on the overall costs. It was found that using algae burial to offset carbon emissions is not viable for principle reasons such as the amount of water required and the burial of phosphate as well as more than doubling the current diesel price. This price is mainly due to the high costs of pumping dilute algae slurry underground. The biochar burial approach, on the other hand, was found to be much more economically viable as it only increases the conventional diesel price by a small amount. This comparably low price is due to the revenue generated from selling the electricity produced from the pyrolysis by-products. In addition, the global sensitivity analysis revealed that the overall costs were the most sensitive to the wood price, as the wood feedstock may either be an income or an expenditure. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Highest third worldwide production of the agricultural product namely rice causes a huge quantity of waste residues especially, rice bran concurrently with rice husk. It fabricates the residual wastes nearly of about 31.9 MMT annually throughout the world and owing to the thermal point of view they are not easily upgradable due to high silica content. Meanwhile, rice bran after extrusion in broilers have been used to extract oil containing free fatty acids (FFAs) (15–30%) such as cis–9–, &amp; cis–12–octadecadienoic and cis–9, cis–12 &amp; cis–15–octadecatrienoic oils. Rice bran fatty oil methyl esters are suitably converted into biodiesel for compression ignition (CI) engines via transesterification path in the presence of Ni/H2 heterogeneous basic catalytical environment along with 4–methoxy–2–hydroxybenzalidene–p–toluidine promoter. Owing to significant viscous and volatile nature drawbacks of potential alternative first and second generation biofuels, there occur some troubles in their long application in CI engines could effectively minimized by such a catalytical pathway. The literature has been found a very little research on this oil as a potential substitute for petro–diesel. Finally, the produced rice bran based biodiesel was analyzed for its appropriateness as a fuel for CI engines. The outcomes explored the characteristics for the biodiesel extracted, under the most promising circumstances are resembling those of the petro–based fuels. The observed yields are high when compared to other enzymatic transesterification and homogeneous catalysis. In addition, in vitro microbial and antioxidant potentialities of RBOB were tested and compared with standard controls. Alternatively, low value by–products for the biodiesel industries like glycerol were also obtained and it gave oil suitable to feed the power generators. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE)is one kind of renewable biodiesel, which has lower emissions of mono-nitrogen oxides, lower smoke opacity, higher energy contents, lower pour, and cloud points. In this work, phoenix (Firmiana simplex L.)tree seed oil (PTSO)from Sterculiaceae was used as the novel feedstock to produce FAEE. Ethanol was used as fatty acyl acceptor and sodium hydroxide was employed as a catalyst. Response surface methodology was used to evaluate and optimize the effect of transesterification variables on FAEE yield. The effect of reaction variables on the transesterification was as follows: catalyst concentration > transesterification temperature > substrate ratio. Transesterfication variables were optimized as follows: 0.3% catalyst concentration with 10.8:1 substrate ratio (ethanol to PTSO, mol/mol)at 52.7 °C for 20 min. Under these optimized transesterification variables, the maximum FAEE yield (97.4 ± 1.7%)was obtained. These can provide an efficient and effective information for biodiesel preparation using PTSO as the novel feedstock. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Butanol is a potential alternative fuel for compensating the depletion of fossil based liquid fuels. Butanol can be easily mixed with either gas or petrol, at any percentage and used as a fuel. Clostridia are the main fermentative organisms used for the production of biobutanol. They are potentially known for their capacity to ferment different types of renewable biomass to butanol through the acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation pathway. This review deals with the mechanism of biobutanol production from biomass feedstocks and the issues and challenges involved in the production of biobutanol. The different types of anaerobic biobutanol production namely fed-batch fermentation, continuous fermentation, and two-stage continuous fermentation have been clearly enunciated. Further, different butanol recovery methods such as adsorption, gas stripping and pervaporation have also been discussed in this review. Certain issues affecting the biobutanol production such as sporulation and solventogenesis have been summarized. These types of problems could be overcome by metabolic engineering of Clostridia, which will enhance the resistance of the microorganisms towards high solvent concentrations and thereby increasing the solvent production. The genetic engineering approach is able to overcome the constraints with wild-type strain by understanding the process of solventogenesis in order to construct or modify the strains with improved downstream processing potential for economically advantageous biobutanol production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In-depth knowledge on pyrolysis behavior of lignocellulosic biomass is pivotal for efficient design, optimization, and control of thermochemical biofuel production processes. Experimental thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)is usually employed to peruse the pyrolysis kinetics of biomass samples. In addition to that, the main constituents of biomass (i.e., cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin)as well as the process heating rate can excellently reflect its pyrolysis characteristics through modeling techniques. However, the application of statistical and phenomenological models for extremely complex and highly nonlinear phenomena like lignocellulose pyrolysis is challenging. To address this challenge, adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)was consolidated with particle swarm optimization (PSO)algorithm to prognosticate the kinetic constants of lignocellulose pyrolysis. More specifically, the PSO algorithm was applied to tune membership function parameters of the ANFIS model. Three ANFIS−PSO topologies were designed and trained to estimate the kinetic constants of lignocellulose pyrolysis, i.e., energy of activation, pre-exponential coefficient, and order of reaction. The input variables of the developed models were biomass main constituents and the process heating rate. The developed models could predict the kinetic constants of lignocellulosic biomass pyrolysis with an R2 &gt; 0.970, an MAPE &lt; 3.270%, and an RMSE &lt; 5.006. The pyrolysis behaviors of three different biomass feedstocks (unseen data to the developed models)were adequately prognosticated with an R2 &gt; 0.91 using the developed models, further confirming their fidelity. Overall, the lignocellulose pyrolysis behavior could be reliably and accurately estimated using the trained ANFIS–PSO approaches as an alternative to the TGA measurements. In order to make practical use of the trained models, a handy freely-accessible software platform was designed using the selected ANFIS−PSO models for approximating biomass pyrolysis kinetics. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Depleting fossil fuel resources and related environmental concerns have focused the world's attention on finding sustainable and renewable energy resources such as biofuels. Biodiesel, produced from vegetable oil, animal fats, waste cooking oil, and greases, shows a promising alternative for petroleum-diesel. The conventional biodiesel production methods are time consuming and energy intensive due to mass transfer limitations. This limitation can be reduced by carrying out reaction at a bubble interface which supplies a “local” excess of alcohol to push equilibrium in the forward direction while simultaneously increasing the rate of reaction. During this process, methanol vapors, fed through a sintered borosilicate diffuser, react with the free fatty acids (oleic acid in this case)and catalyst. Owing to the lower flow rates of methanol and pore size of the diffuser (15–40 μm)used, the bubbles produced are significantly smaller 1 mm and lies in the range of 200–600 μm. Kinetic study shows that reaction follows first order kinetics w.r.t. oleic acid. The esterification reaction through bubble reactor achieved 97% conversion of oleic acid in 30 min as compared with 80% in 312 min using conventional methods. © 2019

AB  - The biofuel chemicals, 5-ethoxymethylfufural (EMF)and 5-methoxymethylfufural (MMF)have been prepared from various carbohydrates in alcoholic solvents. The porous polymeric material PSDVB-SO3H was employed as a heterogeneous catalyst in this investigation and the reaction parameters; time, temperature, catalyst/feedstock loading and co-solvent were optimized. As a result of the acid density and mesoporous structure, PSDVB-SO3H efficiently catalyzed the ethanolysis of fructose to EMF in a 67.5% yield (2 h, 393 K). Whereas MMF was obtained in a 31.6% yield from the catalytic methanolysis of fructose. Compared to commercial Amberlyst-15, less time was required for PSDVB-SO3H to obtain a comparable yield of EMF. Alkyl levulinates and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF)were the main co-products in these reactions, with yields in the range of 0–67% obtained from the catalytic alcoholysis of fructose. Furthermore, by using a “two-step, one-pot” route with successive addition of zeolite zeolite and PSDVB-SO3H to a solution of glucose, EMF was achieved in a yield of 39.4%. © 2019

AB  - The main aim of this experimental work is to reduce engine-out carbon dioxide (CO2)emission of CI engine fuelled with Karanja oil methyl ester (K100). K100 emitted higher NO and CO2 and lower smoke in comparison to diesel as a result of high fuel borne carbon and oxygen. Various techniques namely 1. Low-carbon biofuel blending 2. Post-combustion carbon capture system (PCCCS)3. Oxygenate blending 4. Pre-combustion treatment system was adopted to reduce CO2 emission. Equal volume blending of low-carbon biofuels namely eucalyptus oil (EU), camphor oil (CMO), pine oil (PO)and Orange oil (ORG)with K100 reduces CO2 emission. K50-O50 blend emitted minimum CO2, about 27% less in comparison to K100. PCCCS with zeolite, activated carbon and liquid mono ethanolamine (MEA)injection with K50-O50 reduced CO2 emission further. CO2 emission for K50-O50 + zeolite is 13.5% less in comparison to K50-O50 at maximum load. CO2 is further reduced with oxygenate blending. Oxygenates namely methanol (M), ethanol (E), n-butanol (B), n-pentanol (P)and acetone (A)were blended 20% by volume (based on the knock limit)with K50-O50 and tested along with zeolite based PCCCS. Among the oxygenates, methanol blending with K50-O50 with ZPCCCS lessened CO2 emission by 65% in comparison to K100. Magnetic fuel reforming system based pre-combustion treatment system reduced CO2 emission further. The combination of all the techniques emitted 68.5% less CO2 in comparison to K100 at maximum load. The effect of the techniques on other emission and performance parameters were also discussed in detail. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An efficient solid base catalyst derived from waste borosilicate glass, by its reaction with sodium hydroxide, is used here for the production of biodiesel from used cooking oil. The active phase of the catalyst is found to be Na2SiO3 and the material is highly effective in the production of fuel grade biodiesel till 4 numbers of repeated cycles. The catalyst is found to be tolerant to free fatty acid and water content in the oil feedstock. The procedure is up-graded in pilot scale with the aid of a set up made of polypropylene vessels where the formation of high pressure is avoided in the reactors by the continuous condensation of methanol, making the process a safer one. We report the use of a solid catalyst derived from waste materials in a pilot-scale biodiesel production unit for the first time, which has the potential to have an easy and cost-effective industrial scale up. The performance of the prepared biodiesel and its blends with petrodiesel in diesel engine is investigated and it is found that the biodiesel blend (B10)showed the best performance at all engine loads. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Enzymatic production of biodiesel from waste cooking oils (WCOs)is expected as an efficient procedure for resolving the problems of energy demand and environment pollutions. But, high cost of lipases has been found as a main obstacle to commercialize the enzymatic transesterification. In the present study, cross-linked enzyme aggregates of Km12 lipases have been coupled with amino coated magnetite nanoparticles. SEM analysis showed that mCLEAs-lipase (mCLEAs-lip)nanocomposites have spherical structures. The mCLEAs-lip displayed a shift in optimal pH towards the alkaline, whereas optimal temperature was also shift towards low temperature. mCLEAs-lip nanocomposite reserves its total activity up to 6 cycles of enzyme re-using. Furthermore, it reserves 60% of its initial activity more than free enzyme after 24 days of incubation at 4 °C. Biodiesel production from waste cooking oils by immobilized enzyme increased about 20% more than free enzyme. Therefore, the present study displays great practical latent to produce renewable fuel such as biodiesel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Even if sewage sludge gain acceptance as a potential feedstock for biodiesel (BD)production, water content and contaminants in sewage sludge still remain as obstacles for the production and quality of biodiesel, respectively. Crude BD was produced from a feedstock of wet sewage sludge with 85% water content via in-situ wet-transesterification in a bench-scale (10 L)reactor, and then further treated for enhancing the BD quality to a transportation grade through a series of refining processes. The wet-transesterification was optimized in terms of crude BD yield by varying methanol dosage, methanol/co-solvent (xylene)ratio and reaction time. The maximum crude BD yield and the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME)content were 11.05 and 67.41%, respectively, when methanol dosage, methanol/co-solvent and reaction time were 15 mL/g, 0.5 and 12 h, respectively. The refining process consisting of vacuum distillation, degumming and neutralization, which satisfied the BD standards (EN14214)and visually improved color and transparency. Based on GC-FID analysis, the FAME content in the refined BD highly increased by eliminating the residual impurities. Applicability of the refined BD as a transportation fuel was confirmed by comparing the quality of the BD blended with the commercial petroleum-diesel (PD)at 3% (BD3)with the standard specification. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Castor plant (Ricinus communis)is a fast growing, perennial shrub also known as wonder tree from Euphorbiaceae family. India ranks globally first with production of 87% of the castor seed, while second and third largest producer countries, China and Brazil produced 5% and 1%, respectively. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL)is one of the most promising thermochemical conversion process used to convert wet/high moisture biomass to biofuels and value-added hydrocarbons. HTL of castor residue (stem and leaves)was performed at 260, 280, 300 °C and 15, 30, 60, 90 min. Investigations on the effect of temperature and residence time on distribution of products (bio-oil, bio-char)indicated the maximum Total Bio-oil (TBO)yield of c.a. 15.8 wt% was obtained at 300 °C at 60 min. The major compounds observed by GC-MS were phenols and their derivatives, aromatic hydrocarbons, N-containing compounds, acids. In addition, the recovery of carbon and corresponding energy recovery with respect to castor residue indicated that the carbon and energy recovery for bio-oil 1 were 24.23% and 31.08% respectively. An increase in the carbon and decrease of oxygen content in bio-oil (BO)demonstrates that the castor residue can be used as a potential feedstock for bioenergy applications. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fossil fuels consumption rate is an important issue which needs to be addressed regarding future perspectives in terms of the world overall energy requirement due to its exhausting nature and also due to environmental concern. Hence, more diversified research for alternate sources of fuel is needed, even to the extent of using only dual fuels; a mixture of high and low viscous fuel to eliminate diesel from compression ignition (CI) engines completely. In the present study, soya and soya ethanol blends are used as fuels for the CI engine. Besides the use blends in a diesel engine, the response surface methodology technique is also implemented for getting better responses. RSM results confirm that the use of dual fuel results in satisfactory engine performance and emission in a standard diesel engine without any modification in the engine. Blends, engine speed, air flow rate, and engine load are the input variables considered for attaining better BTE, VE, CO, HC, and NOx as the responses. From all the tested fuel blends considered in the study, the result shows that a blend of soya biodiesel with 8% blending with dual fuel mode at 1486 RPM, 49.5 mm manometer air flow, 6.27 kg engine load show an overall good engine performance. The performance and emission characteristics (BTE, VE, CO, HC, and NOx emission) are found to be 24.29%, 68.53%, 0.0715% volume, 51.6 ppmv and 1080.2 ppmv respectively. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) followed by catalytic hydrotreating of the produced biocrude is increasingly gaining ground as an effective technology for the conversion of biomass into liquid biofuels. A strong advantage of HTL resides in its great flexibility towards the feedstock, since it is able to treat a large number of different organic substrates, ranging from dry to wet residual biomass. Nevertheless, the characteristics of biocrudes from different typologies of organic materials result in different challenges to be met during the hydrotreating step, leading to differences in heteroatoms removal and in the typology and composition of the targeted products. In this work, biocrudes were catalytically hydrotreated with a commercial NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst at different temperatures and pressures. Sewage sludge biocrude was found to be very promising for the production of straight-chain hydrocarbons in the diesel range, with considerable heteroatoms removal even at mild hydrotreating conditions. Similar results were shown by algal biocrude, although complete denitrogenation is challenging. Upgraded biocrudes from lignocellulosic feedstock (miscanthus) showed high yields in the gasoline range, with a remarkable content of aromatics. Operating at a higher H2 pressure was found to be crucial to prevent coking and decarboxylation reactions. © 2019

AB  - 500 h durability, performance and emission tests are conducted on a single cylinder high speed automotive diesel engine for the ethanol blended biodiesel fuel. Esterified cotton seed methyl ester of 5% by volume is mixed with 95% neat diesel to obtain the base biodiesel fuel (B5). The base fuel is mixed with 20% pure ethanol to derive the ethanol blended biodiesel fuel (B5E20). The parameters like blow-by, crank case pressure and lubricating oil consumption are experimentally investigated along with performance and emission characteristics for both the test fuelled engines. The result of these tests showed a significant loss in maximum brake power and maximum brake torque at the end of 500 h durability run when the engine is fuelled with B5E20. The lubricating oil consumption and positive crank pressure of B5E20 fuelled engine is comparatively higher than B5 fuelled engine during the durability trials. Reduction in smoke and CO emissions are noticed for B5E20 fuel over the entire range of speed whereas NOX and unburned hydro carbon emissions get decreased at lower to medium speed range and increases thereafter. As expected, all the engine emissions increase after 500 h of durability run for both the fuels. © 2019

AB  - Purpose: Renewable gasoline and diesel can be produced through integrated hydropyrolysis and hydroconversion (IH2) using renewable feedstocks such as woody biomass from logging residues. This study assesses the potential environmental impacts of IH2 process fuels manufactured in Ontonagon, Michigan, to determine their environmental impacts and if these manufactured fuels will meet Renewable Fuel Standards (RFS) requirements. The energy return on investment (EROI) is also calculated for comparison to other renewable fuels. Methods: A cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment was conducted using regional forestry, timber harvest, and transportation data from the region. Regional geographic data was used to determine service areas that may provide woody biomass. The service areas were then developed into inventory data based upon the type and distribution of potential woody biomass feedstocks. Survey data from loggers in the region were used to ensure that harvest types were allocated in accordance with regional activity. Remaining inventory items were derived from existing data in the literature or existing life cycle inventory databases. This study uses a functional unit of one megajoule of gasoline or diesel produced using the IH2 process and assessed several environmental indicators as well as EROI. Results and discussion: Fuels produced generate approximately 88% less greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to petroleum fuels given RFS assumptions. Manufacturing and transportation of feedstocks accounts for 92.19% of energy used in production giving a calculated EROI of 4.19 and 4.31 per kilogram of diesel and gasoline, respectively. Pessimistic estimates of soil organic carbon (SOC) loss result in GHG emissions that are approximately 83% lower. If a 1:0.5 displacement ratio of IH2 fuels is considered, the GHG emissions are about 76% lower without SOC loss and 66% lower with. This study demonstrates that while environmental impacts and EROI are sensitive to site selection and SOC estimates, there is a sufficient GHG emission reduction such that IH2 fuels are capable of meeting regulatory requirements. Conclusions: Fuels produced at the facility result in a reduction in GHG emissions, but better site selection may result in less fuel being used in transportation. Reducing the quantity of electricity needed in n-th–generation facilities would also reduce environmental impacts while improving the EROI. The energy mix used to supply IH2 facilities should also be considered during the planning process. Finally, future research may be needed to ensure feedstocks recovered from logging operations match expectations. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In the present study, a high-viscous biofuel, namely wheat germ oil (WGO), and a low-viscous biofuel, namely pine oil (PO), are used in a twin-cylinder diesel engine. The fuel ionization filter is fitted with a permanent magnet, an electromagnet, and the combination of permanent magnet and electromagnet, and their effect on the engine performance, emission, and combustion is studied. A fuel ionization filter placed in the fuel line, before the injection pump, ionizes the fuel molecules and increases the rate of disintegration of droplets due to a decrease in viscosity and surface tension. The tests are performed at a constant engine speed of 1500 rpm with loads varying from no load to full load at intervals of 25%. As compared to diesel, the engine operation with ionization filter increased brake thermal efficiency and reduced the fuel consumption for both PO and WGO. The increase in brake thermal efficiency is in the order: permanent magnet, electromagnet, and combination of electromagnet and permanent magnet. The magnetic field strength of electromagnet is higher than permanent magnet which tends to increase the ionization of the fuel. When both the magnets are combined, the magnetic field strength further increases resulting in more ionization of the fuel. It is also perceived that magnetic effect reduces the viscosity of the fuel. Regulated emissions, namely unburned hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and smoke emissions, reduced, whereas NOx emissions increased with WGO and ionization filter. With pine oil and ionization filter, all the regulated emissions decreased as compared to neat pine oil. The reduction in HC, CO, and smoke emissions was highest for combination of electromagnet and permanent magnet followed by electromagnet and permanent magnet. The study shows that combination of permanent magnet and electromagnet resulted in the best engine performance and emission characteristics. © 2019, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - Ethanol is an alternative fuel produced from sugarcane and economically very important for São Paulo state and Brazil. Vinasse, which has been traditionally distributed on the agricultural soil as an organic fertilizer, is the main residue of the ethanol production. Its dosage has been annually rationed in function of the potassium balance for reuse in agriculture. The vinasse potassium for ferti-irrigation can fully substitute potassium from mineral sources, but its transport is economically unviable from a determined distance. In this context, the paper presents the dehydration of sugarcane vinasse using a reverse osmosis technology to reduce the cost of transport until the sugarcane tillage. The main contributions are the reduction in the water content (concentration) and increase in the solid and the potassium content (13.8%). The study showed a payback value of 5.49 years. © 2019, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - The major water-soluble ions, organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC) and mass concentration of fine- (PM2.5) and coarse-mode (PM10–2.5) aerosols were measured at Pune during January–December 2016. The mass closure approach was used by comparing the sum of the masses of the individual chemical species to the gravimetric PM obtained by weighting the filter samples. The 1 year mean total mass concentration of fine and coarse mode was 40 µgm−3 (64%) and 23 µg m−3 (36%), respectively. The PM2.5/PM10 ratio was 0.64 ± 0.9 indicating an abundance of fine-mode particles over Pune during the study period. A principal component analysis identified three components, where the one with highest explanatory power (59%) displayed clear impact of anthropogenic sources on the measured mass concentration of a majority of the compounds. The strong linear relationships between EC, OC, nss-SO4 2− and nss-K+ suggest a predominance of a common primary source, with a contribution from biofuel as well as biomass burning sources. Keeping the strong correlation and sources of individual chemical species as the base, it was noticed that (1) major contributors to fine- and coarse-mode particles over the Pune regions are carbonaceous aerosols and secondary inorganic aerosols (non-sea-salt SO4 2−, NO3 −, and NH4 +), (2) anthropogenic aerosols contribute mostly to the fine-mode, and (3) meteorological parameters play an important role in controlling levels of fine- and coarse-mode particles. Taken together, the study clearly indicates the dominance of anthropogenic sources during the entire year with more significance in the winter season. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - As a derivative product of bio-glycerol, this study first uses solketal as a combustion improver for enhancing diesel engine characteristics. The emulsions of nanometer- and micrometer-sized droplets of solketal, which disperse evenly in the ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD), are formed by the effects of microwave irradiation. The performance of diesel engine fueled with the nanoemulsion of ULSD with scattered solketal droplets is analyzed and compared to that with the microemulsion. The experimental results show that the nanoemulsions can form when over 15 wt. % surfactant mixtures of Span 80 and Tween 80 and less than 5 wt. % solketal are mixed and emulsified with the remaining ULSD content, which acts as the continuous phase of the emulsions. The nanoemulsions are observed to have significantly lower brake-specific fuel consumption (bsfc) and higher fuel conversion efficiency and exhaust gas temperature than those of the microemulsions and the neat ULSD. However, the bsfc of the nanoemulsions increases with greater engine speed and gradually approaches those of the latter two test fuels. In addition, the dispersed solketal droplet sizes are mostly concentrated around 127 nm with peak intensity of 12.65% in the nanoemulsions. The microwave-assisted formation used in this study is found to successfully produce the nanoemulsions in which all of the dispersed droplet sizes are much smaller than 1000 nm. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - This experimental study aims to mitigate harmful emissions from a CI engine using bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) approach. The engine used for this experimental work is a single cylinder CI engine with a rated power of 5.2 kW at a constant speed of 1500 rpm. The BECCS approach is a combination of plant-based biofuels and carbon capture and storage (CCS) system. The whole investigation was done in four phases: (1) Substituting diesel with Karanja oil methyl ester (KOME) (2) Equal volume blending of Orange oil (ORG) with KOME (3) 20% blending of n-butanol (B) with KOME-ORG blend (4) CCS system with zeolite based non-selective catalytic reduction (NSCR) and mono ethanolamine (MEA) based selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) system with KOME-ORG + B20 blend. The experimental results show that substitution of diesel with KOME reduces smoke emission, but increases NO and CO2 emission. KOME-ORG blend reduces CO2 and smoke emissions with high NO emission due to combustion improvement. In comparison with the sole combustion of KOME at full load condition, the combination of KOME-ORG + B20 as bio-fuel with zeolite based post-combustion treatment system resulted in a maximum reduction of NO, smoke and CO2 emission by 41%, 19% and 15% respectively. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Although ethanol remains the dominant liquid biofuel in the global market, there is a strong interest in high-energy density and low-hygroscopicity compounds that can be incorporated into gasoline at levels beyond the current ethanol blend wall. Isopentenol (3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol) is one of these promising advanced biofuels that is also an important precursor for isoprene (the main component of natural rubber). In this study, we model the production cost, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and water footprint of biologically produced isopentenol, including the current state of the technology and the impact of potential improvements. We find that the minimum selling price of biobased isopentenol, given the current state of technology demonstrated at bench-scale, is $5.14/L-gasoline equivalent, and the GHG footprint exceeds that of gasoline. However, biobased isopentenol could reach a .62/L-gasoline equivalent [.4/gal-gasoline equivalent (gge), just 5% above the 10-year average gasoline price] in an optimized future case where yield and other process parameters are pushed to near their theoretical limits. In this future case, isopentenol could achieve a GHG reduction of 90% relative to gasoline and a carbon abatement cost of $9.3/metric ton CO2e. Reaching these goals will require dramatic improvements in isopentenol yield, near-100% recovery of ionic liquid used in pretreatment, and low-lignin and high-cellulose and -hemicellulose biomass feedstocks. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This paper investigates the effect of some biofuels on thermal balance and performance characteristics of a single-cylinder, four-stroke SI internal combustion engine. In this study, total and instantaneous energy balance of an air-cooled, small-scale engine using various biofuels is investigated. An experimental study is carried out on gasoline engine to validate the numerical calculations. Bio-alternative fuels which include methanol, ethanol and 2-ethanol–gasoline-blended fuels consisting of E85, E15 are examined numerically. Results indicate that methanol is the most effective fuel in aspect of power generation. Ethanol, E85, E15 and gasoline are placed in next positions, respectively. Break specific fuel consumption shows totally reversed trend. It is evaluated that by increasing engine speed, heat transfer to brake power ratio decreases and lower percentage of energy in form of heat transfer is lost. The least heat transfer to brake power ratio among studied fuel is related to methanol which approves it as the most efficient biofuel. Based on instantaneous in-cylinder energy balance analysis, at the end of combustion and during expansion stroke, instantaneous brake work of fuels outpaces each other at around 40° crank angle aTDC. © 2019, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - This study investigates the influence of biodiesels on combustion and emission characteristics in a common-rail equipped small-bore single-cylinder diesel engine. The engine experiments were performed using waste-cooking-oil (WCO), Jatropha-oil, and Karanja-oil derived biodiesels. Conventional diesel was utilized as a baseline fuel. The test engine was operated at a speed of 1200 rpm and an indicated mean effective pressure of 0.5 MPa. The fuels were injected at fuel injection pressures (FIPs) of 40, 80, and 120 MPa. At the same time, the fuel injection timing was varied from −15 crank angle degrees (CAD) after top dead center (aTDC) to −3 CAD aTDC. Experimental results showed that ignition delay was directly correlated to the cetane number and had more significant effect at higher FIPs. The peak of in-cylinder pressure increased as the injection timing was advanced, due to longer ignition delay. Biodiesels showed relatively lower or equal level of nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions compared to conventional diesel. This was mainly due to lower combustion efficiency showing high amount of smoke, HC, and CO emissions from incomplete combustion. However, for the WCO biodiesel, smoke, HC, and CO emissions could be significantly improved than other biodiesel thanks to better atomization and air-fuel mixing process. © 2019

AB  - Discovery of high-yielding microalgae rich in valuable lipids, proteins, pigments, or carbohydrates is essential to the growth of nutraceutical and biofuel industries. Therefore, bioprospecting of microalgae from diverse environmental conditions has become highly significant to meet the demand of such bioresources globally. In this context, bioprospecting of three species of microalgae isolated from bloomed freshwaters of Kerala, India, was carried out; morphological and molecular characterizations revealed two of the algae as new species to science and named accordingly. The industrial potentials of these algae (Fasciculochloris boldii (MH992105.1), Sphaerocystis antoni-kadavilaii Ray &amp; Prasanth sp. nov. (MK005299.1), and Chlorella zachariaii Ray &amp; Prasanth sp. nov. (MH930447.1)) were assessed in terms of biomass yield and biochemical profile. The alga Sphaerocystis antoni-kadavilaii with a biomass yield of 176.8 ± 2.0% increase L−1 day−1, lipid productivity of 4.4 ± 0.3 mg L−1 day−1, the protein content of 46.1%, is found promising, in comparison with the known species such as Spirulina sp. and Chlorella sp. It is high in chlorophyll a, and total carotenoid content as well. The alga Fasciculochloris boldii showed high lipid content of 26.8 ± 1.1% and the alga Chlorella zachariaii showed 30.1% of omega-3 fractions in its total fatty acids. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed biodiesel feasibility of lipids from all these algae. However, the alga Fasciculochloris boldii with high proportions of saturated fatty acids in its lipid (71.2%) can be considered as a potential species for biodiesel as the biodiesel from the same also shows the required cetane number (63.3) and low iodine value (38.9). © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Camelina (Camelina sativa L.) and carinata (Brassica carinata) are nonfood oilseeds known for their potential as a promising biofuel feedstock; however, their associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions under different rates of nitrogen (N) fertilizer has not been well studied. This study was conducted to evaluate the impacts of N fertilization rates on selected soil properties and soil surface GHG fluxes from camelina and carinata fields in South Dakota, USA. The experimental design comprised of four N rates (0, 28, 56, 84 kg N ha−1) in 2014, 2015 and 2016, replicated four times. At harvesting, soil samples were collected in all years at both fields to measure pH, electric conductivity, total nitrogen, and soil organic carbon. The GHG fluxes were taken biweekly from 2014 to 2016 using a static chamber. Our results demonstrated that increasing N fertilization rates resulted in decreased soil pH in the carinata field in 2015 and increased soil organic carbon and electrical conductivity in the camelina field in 2014. Total nitrogen was not affected by N fertilization rates in all years. For the GHG gases, the CO2 and CH4 fluxes were not significantly influenced by the application of N fertilization rates in all years. However, the N2O flux significantly increased with the increasing of N fertilization rates at both fields in 2014 and 2015. In general, the effect of N fertilization rates on soil properties and GHG fluxes in both oilseed crops were similar. Data from this study showed minimal responses of soil properties to N fertilization rates. Increasing N fertilizer application in camelina and carinata crops resulted in higher N2O emissions. Therefore, improved application strategies for N fertilizer management in camelina and carinata crops need to be explored to avoid any negative environmental impacts. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The conventional method of lipid extraction mandatorily includes cell lysis which is considered an essential process for the enhancement of extraction efficiency. However, cell lysis method especially those incorporating mechanical and physical methods such as homogenization, sonication, microwave techniques, etc., are energy intensive and drastically escalates the biofuel production cost. Therefore, the development of an alternate route of extraction skipping the conventional mechanical cell lysis step remains a challenge to be accomplished. In this context, we discuss the reports involving passive techniques that are able to extract lipid from microalgae without significant cell wall shearing. This includes methods such as in-situ transesterification, direct saponification, supercritical fluid extraction, organic solvent extraction, etc. Moreover, the review discusses the employment of passive lipid extraction methods in a biorefinery set-up, outlining the various bioproducts that could be generated along with lipid. The review concludes with the analysis of the economics of microalgal lipid extraction using passive disruption methods and compares with the processes incorporating cell lysis steps. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fuels derived from plant oils hold promise as alternatives to petroleum-derived fuels due to their renewable production strategies, and potential to reduce net carbon emissions. Due to their high viscosity and cloud point, and low volatility however, direct use of plant oils in engines, without transesterification, poses a challenge. Recently, genetic modification has been used to alter plant lipid biosynthesis, producing novel oils that may overcome some of these challenges. In this study, 3-acetyl-1, 2-diacyl-sn-glycerol (Ac-TAG), extracted from a strain of transgenic Camelina Sativa, was studied in an optically-accessible diesel engine. Simultaneous high-speed shadowgraphy and OH* chemiluminescence imaging data were collected to obtain measurements of jet development, liquid penetration, ignition location, and flame liftoff length. A conventional diesel fuel and untransformed neat camelina oil were run at the same conditions as the Ac-TAG fuel for comparison. Even though the Ac-TAG fuel had significantly lower viscosity than the neat camelina oil, no significant differences were observed between Ac-TAG and neat camelina oil in any of the quantities studied. Relative to diesel, the biofuels had greater liquid penetration, shorter liftoff lengths and ignition delay, and consistently ignited farther upstream. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - An efficient bio-based heterogeneous catalyst for biodiesel production was successfully fabricated by radiation-induced graft polymerization of 4-vinylbenzylchloride (VBC)followed by quaternary amination of trimethylamine (TMA)and ion-exchange with aqueous sodium hydroxide onto kenaf bast fiber using electron beam irradiation at a dose of 150 kGy. The produced catalyst was characterized by FESEM–EDX, CHNS, ATR-FTIR, TGA and XRD analyses. In this study, the continuous catalytic transesterification of triolein/ethanol in a bench-scale packed bed reactor (PBR)was designed and tested. The reaction process was focused at room temperature, different residence times from 1 min to 4 min and a molar ratio of triolein/ethanol (1:50). Besides, study on the transesterification of palm oil with ethanol under optimized conditions for maximum conversion of triolein to ethyl oleate (residence time of 3 min, LHSV = 8 h−1, short chain 150kGy catalyst)with temperature fixed at room temperature (˜25 °C)has been carried out. The extracted ethyl oleate was analyzed by HPLC and ATR-FTIR. The results found that the continuous flow system has a great potential for producing ethyl ester to be used as biodiesel and it is possible to generate 100% biodiesel with high purity from palm oil using radiation-induced kenaf catalyst. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Plant-based protein is generally preferred for human consumption, while vegetable oil is becoming increasingly popular for industrial uses. It is of importance to evaluate the oil and protein production potential of non-traditional Brassicaceae oilseeds for use as feedstock. In this study, oil and protein contents and their relationship with seed yield were determined for oriental mustard (Brassica juncea L.), canola (Brassica napus L.), camelina (Camelina sativa L.), Ethiopian mustard (Brassica carinata A. Braun), and yellow mustard (Sinapis alba L.)grown across diverse environments. These oilseeds were studied at Lethbridge, Scott, and Swift Current on the Canadian prairie during 2014–2016. Seed oil and protein contents had an inverse relationship with a wide variation among the oilseeds. Oil and protein contents of canola were 48 and 22%, respectively, while S. alba had the lowest oil (29%)but the highest protein (34%)contents. The oil yield (oil concentration by seed mass)was significantly higher in canola (1358 kg ha−1)compared with other oilseeds. Protein yield was in a narrow range with the highest in canola and S. alba (617 and 597 kg ha−1, respectively), and the lowest in camelina (456 kg ha−1). Oil yield was generally higher in site-years with higher precipitation combined with lower temperature during grain filling, whereas protein yield did not have a consistent trend with growing conditions. Considering oil and protein yields across site-years, B. juncea and carinata could be considered as potential alternatives to conventional rapeseed as industrial feedstock sources on the Canadian prairies. © 2019

AB  - Biofuels can contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector. Ethanol is the main additive for gasoline in the United States, and gasoline containing 10 vol% ethanol is the most commonly used transportation fuel. However, the vapor pressure of these blends is significantly higher than gasoline, which contributes to evaporative emissions. One way to circumvent this and other issues is to use a dual-alcohol approach, mixing lower (methanol or ethanol) and higher alcohols with gasoline to obtain a blend with a vapor pressure close to that of the base gasoline. The goal of this study was to evaluate the fuel potential of dual alcohol blends experimentally and theoretically. Ten dual-alcohol blends were tested at blending ratios from 10 to 80 vol%, with methanol and ethanol used as the lower alcohols and iso-butanol and 3-methyl-3-pentanol as the higher alcohols. The corresponding single alcohol-gasoline blends were also evaluated. For each blend, Reid vapor pressure, vapor lock protection potential, distillation curve, lower heating value, kinematic viscosity, and water tolerance at three temperatures were measured. A model of droplet evaporation was also applied to provide insights into the azeotropic volatility behavior and mixing/sooting potential of the blends. The results of this study show that it is advantageous to use dual-alcohol blends containing up to 40 vol% because they have the characteristics necessary for good performance in existing spark-ignition engines, particularly in terms of volatility, kinematic viscosity, and water tolerance. This study is the first to characterize matched vapor pressure, dual-alcohol blends over a wide blending range as drop-in fuels for conventional spark ignition engines. Furthermore, this was the first investigation of the fuel potential of iso-butanol in dual-alcohol blends and of 3-methyl-3-pentanol in single- and dual-alcohol blends. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biochar is widely used for various environmental remediation strategies such as soil amendment because of its intrinsic carbon negativity and porosity. Biochar is a charcoal-like material produced via pyrolysis of biomass. To determine an effective method for modification of the porosity and morphology of biochar and establishment of a more sustainable pyrolysis platform for biomass valorization, this study used CO2 as a reactive gas medium in the biomass pyrolysis process. This study placed emphasis on elucidating the role of CO2 in the production of biochar from different types of biomass, such as cellulose, xylan, lignin, grass, and oak wood. The surface area and porosity of biochar were strongly related to the type of biomass. Under comparable pyrolysis conditions, the surface area of biochar decreased in the following order: cellulose &gt; xylan &gt; lignin ∼ oak wood &gt; grass. The use of CO2 as the gas medium in biomass pyrolysis affected the surface area and porosity of biochar samples derived from biomass feedstock. For instance, the surface area and total pore volume of the oak-wood-derived biochar produced in the CO2 environment were twice those produced in the N2 environment. Given that the increases in the biochar surface area and porosity were attributed to the enhanced release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)from biomass, CO2 may have enhanced VOC release (removal)during pyrolysis. Therefore, the use of CO2 in a pyrolysis platform is expected to be a strategic approach for biomass valorization. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Microalgae are a group of microorganisms considered to be a potential source of next-generation biofuel owing to high photosynthetic rate. However, biofuel compounds including lipid, carbohydrate, and hydrogen are not sufficiently produced by microalgae under normal conditions; therefore economical viability of microalgal biofuel production has not reached the ultimate stage of commercial viability. In order to overcome the above limitation, various stress conditions have been applied on microalgae to boost lipid, carbohydrate and hydrogen production. Even though stress conditions increases the production of biofuel compounds, microalgae growth is severely affected. In this regard, a two-stage cultivation mode wherein first stage involving high biomass production under media optimized heterotrophic condition and second stage involving lipid, carbohydrate and hydrogen accumulation under stress integrated phototrophic mode is considered as a potential route for biofuel production in microalgae. The present review critically evaluates various two-stage strategies adopted in microalgal biofuel production by comparing lipid, carbohydrate and hydrogen productivities with that of single stage cultivation. In addition, advantages of two-stage cultivation including co-product generation, less bacterial contamination, improved biodiesel quality, auto-flocculation, and bioremediation potential are also discussed. Finally, the paper summarizes the two-stage cultivation modes by identifying the bottlenecks and suggesting the future potentialities of the process. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper explores the compatibility of biodiesel with different grades of polyethylene, specifically examining the extent of plasticization in order to gain a better understanding of the biofuel's compatibility with this common polymer. Its bulk influences on polyethylene were investigated by gravimetric and mechanical testing, and by the application of a newly developed nondestructive ultrasonic testing method. Diffusion rates and the extent of plasticization by biodiesel were compared to results obtained with toluene, a known plasticizer for polyethylene. Mechanical and gravimetric analysis showed that biodiesel exhibited bulk attributes of a plasticizer for the tested polyethylenes with reduced moduli proportional to the amount of fuel uptake and that uptake was inversely proportional to crystalline content of the polymer. Based on uptake amounts, the efficiency of biodiesel as a plasticizer towards polyethylene was found to be more than double that of toluene. However, spectral analysis by ultrasonics showed that absorbed toluene and biodiesel influenced the microstructure of polyethylene differently. Notable differences in internal stresses were noted between the two fluids for the same amount absorbed. A subsequent study analyzed the impact that biodiesel degradation had on plasticization. Although the trend showed a slight change in diffusion rate with increasing oxidation of the medium, the mechanical and ultrasonic results did not show significant differences between fresh and degraded biodiesel within the 45 days span of the test. Combining the evidence observed in this study, a mechanism is proposed for biodiesel plasticization that can help with failure prevention and material selection. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This article contributes to scholarly understanding of how policy ideas and institutions interact to affect policy change by investigating why legislation mandating the use of biofuels in transport vehicles has been upheld in the USA but scaled back in the European Union. To explain this puzzle, the article advances propositions regarding the role of multidimensional policy ideas, policy anomalies and institutional gatekeepers in legislative agenda-setting. Using structural topic modelling and qualitative methods, the analyses demonstrate that differences in action frames follow from agenda-setting institutions. The corporate structure of the European Commission ensures that EU agenda-setters are reasonably attentive to policy anomalies. By contrast, individuals with agenda-setting authority in the US Congress are liable to discount anomalies by limiting their focus to certain aspects of multidimensional policy issues. Moreover, individuals with gatekeeping authority may prevent repeal bills from accessing the legislative agenda. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The low-cost and environmentally friendly solid acid catalysts for the efficient synthesis of ethyl levulinate fuel additives were prepared from pine needles through the partial carbonization, followed by a hydrothermal H2SO4 sulfonation procedure. The resultant sulfonated carbon catalysts possessed an amorphous carbon structure and high contents of the sulfate groups. Other than that, they had good thermal stability and the total acid density was as high as 2.28 mmol g−1. In this work, noticeably, the parameters of both synthetic and catalytic reactions were optimized to enhance the conversion of levulinic acid (LA). The results showed that the LA conversion was as high as 96.1% over the catalysts carbonizated at 700 °C for 90 min and sulfonated at 160 °C for 15 h under the optimized conditions (5:1 ethanol/LA molar ratio, 5 wt% catalyst dosage, 80 °C reaction temperature, 8 h reaction time). Meanwhile, the recyclability experiments confirmed that the resultant catalysts exhibited satisfactory reusability and the corresponding conversion of LA was maintained as 63.0% in the fourth run. Remarkably, the reused catalysts can be easily activated again and the corresponding LA conversion could reach up to 90.1%. The results demonstrated that the catalysts had great potential in the synthesis of biofuels, which could be efficient and could have excellent recyclability. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - • Background and Aims Jatropha curcas (jatropha) is an oil crop cultivated in (sub)tropical regions around the world, and holds great promise as a renewable energy source. However, efforts to fully commercialize jatropha are currently hampered by the lack of genetic diversity in the extant breeding germplasm, and by the toxicity of its seeds meaning that its seed cake cannot be used as a protein source in animal feed, among other constraints. In Mexico, the species’ native range, there are jatropha plants whose seeds are used to prepare traditional meals. This non-toxic jatropha ‘type’ is considered to harbour low genetic variation due to a presumed domestication bottleneck and therefore to be of limited breeding value; yet, very little is known regarding its origin and genetic diversity. • Methods Using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), we extensively genotyped both indigenous toxic and non-toxic jatropha collected along roads and home gardens throughout southern Mexico. • Key Results Single nucleotide polymorphism diversity in non-toxic jatropha is relatively high, particularly in northern Veracruz state, the probable origin of this germplasm. Genetic differences between toxic and non-toxic indigenous genotypes are overall quite small. A a genome-wide association study supported a genomic region (on LG 8, scaffold NW_012130064), probably involved in the suppression of seed toxicity. • Conclusions Conservation actions are urgently needed to preserve this non-toxic indigenous, relatively wild germplasm, having potential as a fuel feedstock, animal feed and food source among other uses. More generally, this work demonstrates the value of conservation genomic research on the indigenous gene pool of economically important plant species. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Biofuels are already part of the energy matrix in many countries because of their environmental and economic benefits. Ethyl biodiesel can be produced by various processes, the main one being transesterification of triglyceraldehydes and ethanol. The current technological challenge is to develop efficient heterogeneous catalysts, at low cost, non-polluting and recyclable to be used in this process. In this context, hydromagnesites Mg5(CO3)4(OH)2⋅4H2O modified with different cations (Ca2+, Zn2+, Cu 2+, Ba2+) and synthesized by co-precipitation are used as precursors of catalytic oxides calcined at 600 °C. The biodiesel synthesis was conducted at 120 °C for 12 h using 20% (w/w) of catalyst per mass of soybean oil and the ratio 1:20 (mol/mol) of soybean oil/ethanol. The alkyl esters formed were quantified by Gas Chromatography-Flame Ionization Detection (GC-FID). The transesterification reaction catalyzed by the reference oxide had a yield of 40%, whereas the best yield (80%) came from the hydromagnesite modified with 20% of Ca2+ which also had the highest basicity/acidity ratio. After use in three reaction cycles, the catalyst with 20% Ca2+ had no significant reduction in efficiency when it was washed with acetone and recalcined at 600 °C, while the untreated catalyst only had a yield of 42%, showing the need for effective reconditioning. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Biofuel mixed with fossil jet fuels has a lot of potential in applications of jet fuel extenders. To understand the fundamental properties of this typical mixture, measurements on densities and viscosities for the ternary model system of exo-tetrahydrodicyclopentadiene (1) + isopropylcyclohexane (2) + methyl laurate (3) and three corresponding binary mixtures have been implemented over the entire composition range at eleven different temperatures from 293.15 to 343.15 K. The excess molar volumes (VmE) and viscosity deviations (δη) of binary mixtures were calculated and correlated by the Redlich-Kister equation, while the corresponding data of ternary mixtures were fitted to Nagata-Tamura, Cibulka, Singh, and Redlich-Kister equations. Furthermore, the variations of VmE and δη were represented and discussed based on molecular interactions and structural effects in detail. Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - We identify sources (fossil fuel combustion versus biomass burning) of black carbon (BC) in the atmosphere and in deposition using a global 3-D chemical transport model GEOS-Chem. We validate the simulated sources against carbon isotope measurements of BC around the globe and find that the model reproduces mean biomass burning contribution (fbb; %) in various regions within a factor of 2 (except in Europe, where fbb is underestimated by 63 %). GEOS-Chem shows that contribution from biomass burning in the Northern Hemisphere (fbb: 35-14 %) is much less than that in the Southern Hemisphere (50-11 %). The largest atmospheric fbb is in Africa (64-20 %). Comparable contributions from biomass burning and fossil fuel combustion are found in southern (S) Asia (53-10 %), southeastern (SE) Asia (53-11 %), S America (47-14 %), the S Pacific (47-7 %), Australia (53-14 %) and the Antarctic (51-2 %). fbb is relatively small in eastern Asia (40-13 %), Siberia (35-8 %), the Arctic (33-6 %), Canada (31-7 %), the US (25-4 %) and Europe (19-7 %). Both observations and model results suggest that atmospheric fbb is higher in summer (59 %-78 %, varying with sub-regions) than in winter (28 %-32 %) in the Arctic, while it is higher in winter (42 %-58 %) and lower in summer (16 %-42 %) over the Himalayan-Tibetan Plateau. The seasonal variations of Atmosphericfbb are relatively flat in North America, Europe and Asia. We conducted four experiments to investigate the uncertainties associated with biofuel emissions, hygroscopicity of BC in fresh emissions, the aging rate and size-resolved wet scavenging. We find that doubling biofuel emissions for domestic heating north of 45-N increases fbb values in Europe in winter by-30 %, reducing the discrepancy between observed and modeled atmospheric fbb from 63% to 54 %. The remaining large negative discrepancy between model and observations suggests that the biofuel emissions are probably still underestimated at high latitudes. Increasing the fraction of thickly coated hydrophilic BC from 20% to 70% in fresh biomass burning plumes increases the fraction of hydrophilic BC in biomass burning plumes by 0 %-20% (varying with seasons and regions) and thereby reduces atmospheric fbb by up to 11 %. Faster aging (4 h e-folding time versus 1.15 d e-folding time) of BC in biomass burning plumes reduces atmospheric fbb by 7% (1 %-14 %, varying with seasons and regions), with the largest reduction in remote regions, such as the Arctic, the Antarctic and the S Pacific. Using size-resolved scavenging accelerates scavenging of BC particles in both fossil fuel and biomass burning plumes, with a faster scavenging of BC in fossil fuel plumes. Thus, atmospheric fbb increases in most regions by 1 %-14 %. Overall, atmospheric fbb is determined mainly by fbb in emissions and, to a lesser extent, by atmospheric processes, such as aging and scavenging. This confirms the assumption that fbb in local emissions determines atmospheric fbb in previous studies, which compared measured atmospheric fbb directly with local fbb in bottom-up emission inventories. © Author(s) 2019.

AB  - The use of various biofuels, usually of relatively small Lower Heating Value (LHV), afiects the gas turbine eficiency. The present paper shows that applying the proposed air by-pass system of the combustor at the turbine exit causes tan increase of effciency of the turbine cycle increased by a few points. This solution appears very promising also in combined gas/steam turbine power plants. The comparison of a turbine set operating according to an open cycle with partial bypassing of external combustion chamber at the turbine exit (a new solution) and, for comparison, a turbine set operating according to an open cycle with a regenerator. The calculations were carried out for difierent fuels: Gas from biomass gasification (LHV = 4.4 MJ/kg), biogas (LHV = 17.5 MJ/kg) and methane (LHV = 50 MJ/kg). It is demonstrated that analyzed solution enables construction of several kW power microturbines that might be used on a local scale. Such turbines, operated by prosumer's type of organizations may change the eficiency of electricity generation on a country-wide scale evidently contributing to the sustainability of power generation, as well as the economy as a whole. © 2019 MDPI AG.

AB  - Methanol and ethanol are among the most important biofuels and raw materials used to produce biorenewable fuels. These fuels are used with varying water contents. Nevertheless, the exact impact of the water content of these fuels on the energy potential and combustion characteristics is still unknown. Besides that, there are two noticeable risks (environmental impact of combustion and fire risk) associated with their production, processing, and utilization. Likewise, impact of the water content of these fuels on fire risk and the impact of their combustion on the environment is also unknown. The best indicator of energy potential is the effective heat of combustion, and the best combustion characteristic and indicator of the impact of the combustion of alcohols on the environment is the carbon monoxide (CO) yield, whereas the fire risk of liquid fuels is quantified by the flash point and maximum heat release rate (mHRR). The dependency of flash point on the water content was determined via the Pensky-Martens apparatus and the dependencies of the effective heat of combustion, CO yield, and mHRR on the water content were determined via the cone calorimeter. With increased water content, the flash points of both methanol and ethanol exponentially increased and the both effective heat of combustion and mHRR almost linearly decreased. In the range of water content from 0 to 60%, the CO yield of both methanol and ethanol was practically independent of the water content. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The effect of ammonia and iron concentration in Bold Basal Medium and mixed wastewater (including pretreated piggery wastewater and acid mine drainage) on biomass production and biochemical content (lipid and ß-carotene) of microalgae (Uronema sp. KGE 3) was investigated. Addition of iron to the Bold Basal Medium enhanced the growth, lipid, and ß-carotene of Uronema sp. KGE 3. The highest dry cell weight, lipid content, and lipid productivity of KGE 3 were 0.551 g L−1, 46% and 0.249 g L−1 d−1, respectively, at 15 mg L−1 of Fe. The highest ß-carotene was obtained at 30 mg L−1 of Fe. The biomass production of KGE 3 was ranged between 0.18 to 0.37 g L−1. The microalgal growth was significantly improved by addition of acid mine drainage to pretreated piggery wastewater by membrane. The highest dry cell weight of 0.51 g L−1 was obtained at 1:9 of pretreated piggery wastewater by membrane and acid mine drainage for KGE 3. The removal efficiencies of total nitrogen and total phosphate was ranged from 20 to 100%. The highest lipid and ß-carotene content was found to be 1:9. Application of this system to wastewater treatment plant could provide cost effective technology for the microalgae-based industries and biofuel production field, and also provide the recycling way for pretreated piggery wastewater and acid mine drainage. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Farnesene is an important chemical platform for many industrial products, such as biofuels and polymers. We performed high-efficiency utilization of corncobs for β-farnesene production by separate hydrolysis and fermentation with an optimized Escherichia coli strain. First, we developed a recycling strategy for both corncob pretreatment and cellulose hydrolysis, which saved great amounts of pretreatment reagents and presented a 96.83% cellulose conversion rate into glucose. However, the corncob hydrolysate strongly repressed cell growth and β-farnesene production, being caused by high-concentrated citrate. Through expressing a heterologous ATP citrate lyase and screening for a suitable expression host, an optimized strain was constructed that produced β-farnesene at 4.06 g/L after 48 h in a 5 L fermenter, representing an approximately 2.3-fold increase over the initial strain. Therefore, the proposed strategy about the recycling process and repression elimination was successful and suitable for the production of lignocellulosic-based β-farnesene, which can be further studied to scale up for industrialization. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Numerous research studies have recently demonstrated a huge physical potential of the cascade companies' utilization of the renewable waste ligno-cellulosic biomass sources by the fractionation, de-polymerization and valorization of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, separation, and subsequent catalytic conversion of the monomeric building blocks to biofuels, bio-based chemical substances and biomaterials. 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF), levulinic acid (LA) precursors, and furfural (FUR) are, in most characteristic platform compound compositions, produced by the water-mediated acidic hydrolysis of furans, pentose, and hexose carbohydrate sugars, which can be hydrogenated, oxidized, or dehydrated. These processes were subjected to surprisingly many systematic modeling applications on various operation scales. However, only a limited representative number of works managed to link any of atomistic- (ab initio density functional theory (DFT)), meso- (kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC), mean-field mechanistic rate micro-kinetics and diffusion) or macroscales (computational fluid dynamics (CFD), process model simulations and techno-economics), or integrate them together with classical equipment environment engineering tools (reaction energy thermodynamics, optimizing heat, momentum and mass balances and applicative reactor design). This Review article highlights the integration of interface chemistry methods as an emerging development approach that allows linking the insights about the molecular level measurements with elementary surface steps, while further with diffusive/convective transfers and process integration. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The alkylation of biomass-derived aromatic oxygenates (anisole, phenol, guaiacol, and m-cresol) with furfural alcohol and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural is a step toward high-density biofuel. Conversion and selectivity trends toward monoalkylated products were evaluated in the presence of different operational conditions in batch process. It was observed that FeCl3 was the best catalytic system for phenol alkylation and produced 84.7% monoalkylated product at 80 °C, for 30 min in a continuous nitrogen flow. Guaiacol, anisole, and m-cresol gave 100%, 79.6%, and 85.5% monoalkylated product, respectively. The effect of nitrogen pressure on alkylation was reported for the first time; the monoalkylated product selectivity of phenol, anisole, m-cresol reached 95.5%, 88.7%, and 100% at 4, 8, and 10 bar of N2 pressure, respectively. The alkylation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) with aromatic oxygenates was also studied by replacing furfuryl alcohol with 5-HMF. The selectivity of the monoalkylated product reached almost 100% with every oxygenate, but alkylation of 5-HMF was slower compared to furfuryl alcohol and longer time was required. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Because H2O decreases the acidity of sulfonic acid-based catalysts and initiates catalytic side reactions, the catalytic activity and selectivity of these catalysts are often unsatisfactory in many reactions that generate H2O as a byproduct. Herein, for the first time, hydrophobic acid-functionalized biochar is prepared by a new route based on a two-step diazo grafting method using 4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid as the sulfonated agent and 4-tert-butylaniline as the hydrophobic agent. The acid density and hydrophobicity can be easily regulated by the amounts of benzenesulfonic acid and tert-butylbenzene groups, respectively. The resulting catalysts have a large specific surface area of 400-700 m2/g, high acid density of greater than 2.0 mmol/g, and strong hydrophobicity with an H2O contact angle of up to 136°. Compared with Amberlyst-15 and H2SO4-sulfonated biochar, the hydrophobic acidic biochar exhibits higher activity and selectivity in the alkylation of 4-ethylphenol with phenylmethanol and of 2-methylfuran with cyclic ketones (cyclopentanone and cyclohexanone) for the production of high-density biofuels. The successful preparation of the hydrophobic acidic biochar not only results in an efficient catalyst for reaction systems in which H2O has a deleterious effect but also paves a way for the functional modification of carbonaceous materials. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Among the alternative fuels, vegetable oil is seen as a potential source of energy due to its readily available variety of sources and its certain physical properties that are comparable to those of diesel fuels. However, higher contents of triglyceride in vegetable oil contribute to higher viscosity and density that is affecting the inferior engine performance and emissions. The key properties, such as viscosity, density, and calorific value (CV), have a significant effect on fuel atomization, fuel combustion, and exhaust emissions. In this study, refined palm oil (RPO) was blended with a newly introduced novel biofuel, Melaleuca cajuputi oil (MCO), in order to reduce the viscosity and density and enhance blend properties. This blend is analyzed and compared with RPO–diesel and RPO–ethanol blends in terms of viscosity, CV, and density. These hybrid binary biofuel (HBB) blends were prepared on the volumetric basis of 10%, 20%, 30%, and 50% of MCO, ethanol, and diesel with RPO. The basic fuel properties and the correlation of temperature–viscosity–blend ratio were analyzed. The results showed that the MCO has comparable key properties to those of diesel fuels. The viscosity and density of HBB decrease as the fraction of MCO/ethanol/diesel increases in the blend. The higher the fraction of MCO/diesel in the blend, the higher is the CV observed. Notably, the viscosity of neat RPO and its blends is strongly influenced by temperature variations. The combination of blend technique and preheating had a substantial effect in reducing the viscosity and density of the HBB. Remarkably, the blend of MCO–RPO has the potential to highly considered as a new source of biofuel. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Despite the medicinal values and economic importance, honey is also a source of osmophilic fermentative yeasts. So, it can be utilized for the isolation of local fermentative yeast. Here, 1ml honey was inoculated in yeast extract peptone dextrose (YPD) broth containing 4% dextrose. After overnight incubation, the broth was streaked on an YPD agar plate to purify yeast colonies. In this study, total eight strains were isolated from seven physio-chemically defined florally diversified honey samples of Bangladesh. Microscopic morphology, plasmid profile, growth pattern and fermentative capacity of these isolates were determined. Under light microscope, these yeasts had one of three distinct shapes: ovoid, spherical, or cylindrical. The cytoplasm in young, actively reproducing cells occupied most of the interior and looked homogeneous. Two plasmids of around 3kb and 2.1 kb were common in these strains except for one. While compared with Baker’s yeast, these strains showed faster growth. Five of them were attributed to high fermentative potency. Yeast 2 showed the highest fermentative potency yielding 33.48% (v/v) ethanol. We suggest that these strains have potentialities for efficient bioethanol production to meet the increasing demand of biofuel. © 2019, Bangladesh Society for Microbiology, Immunology and Advanced Biotechnology.

AB  - This paper deals with a performance evaluation of locally made 20L batch type reactor and JP and AM biodiesels produced by using this reactor. The inputs for transesterification process were Jatropha and Argemone Mexicana oils, with an alcohol to oil molar ratio of 6:1, 1% NaOH catalyst, 55 °C reaction temperature, an hour settling time and 600 rpm agitation speed. The conversion ability of the reactor for Jatropha and Argemone Mexicana oil seeds has shown a 94% and 94.5%, respectively. The property of these biodiesels has analyzed and its result was within the limit of ASTM D6751. Performance and emission behavior of different blends of these oils such as B10, B20, B30 and pure diesel were evaluated in a single cylinder, four stroke CI engine with rated speed of 1500 rpm and rated power of 4 kW. The B10 blend has shown closer characteristics in terms of specific fuel consumption, brake thermal efficiency and exhaust gas temperature at different loads to diesel. On the other hand, B10 has resulted with higher CO2 and CO and lower NOx emission potential compared to the two blends. The lower NO2 emission is due to its lowest exhaust gas temperature. The biodiesels finally pass standard tests of EPE by fulfilling the standard parameters that made them competitive and substitute options to diesel fuel. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - In the effort to control global warming and fossil carbon emissions, many countries are proposing new policies to make their energy matrix more renewable. The increase share of bioethanol as a transportation fuel emerges as a short-term solution because its production technology is mature and it can be blended to gasoline. Ethanol production reached 108 billion liters in 2018 and is predicted to increase in the next years. In this work the global CO2-eq emission, which is avoided by the use of 1G and 2G ethanol in the transportation sector, was estimated based on specific cradle-to-grave life-cycle assessments for corn, sugarcane and beet ethanol, and on the volume consumed by top global players. Considering the period 2008–2018, the use of ethanol (mainly 1G) contributed to the reduction of approx. 0.5 billion ton CO2-eq emissions, and will contribute with another 160 billion ton CO2-eq till 2030 (99% from 1G ethanol). © 2019

AB  - NiMo-alumina catalysts with a small quantity of Mo showed ordered mesoporous structure. For 4.3 mmol total metals content, mesoporous structure, however, became disorder for 1.7 mmol and higher Mo content. The C18 alkane was the leading product among hydrocarbons (C15–C22) formed during hydrodeoxygenation of karanja oil. The catalytically active NiMo complex and Mo oxide species with lower oxidation states were substantial in NiMo catalysts with the modest quantity of both Mo and Ni and relatively small for the other two extremes. The catalytic activity and selectivity to C18 alkane were thus enhanced with the rise in Mo content up to 3.4 mmol. The catalytic activity was also improved with growing total metals content and temperature. The optimum catalyst (0.9 mmol Ni and 3.4 mmol Mo) showed the complete conversion of oxygenates with 13 wt% &lt; C18, 75 wt% C18, and 12 wt% &gt; C18 alkanes at 340 °C and 4 h reaction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To make use of molasses wastewater (MW) comprehensively for biofuel production, we studied the effect of exogenous Mg2+ in the MW on the biomass and lipid content in Monoraphidium sp. FXY-10, in which the removal rates of total nitrogen, total phosphorus and chemical oxygen demand (COD) in MW by microalgae were investigated. Results show that when Mg2+ at 800μmol/L, the biomass and lipid content of Monoraphidium sp. FXY-10 were 0.91g/L and 59.58%, which is 1.62 and 1.26-fold of the control group’s, respectively. The fixed efficiency of CO2 increased by 95.15% from that of the control. Meanwhile, the removal rates of total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and COD from the MW reached 88.37%, 93.69%, and 87.98%, respectively. Therefore, Mg2+ addition could promotes the biomass and lipid production in microalgae in MW. Combining wastewater treatment with production of microalgae biodiesel provides a new strategy for the utilization of microalgae. © 2019, Science Press. All right reserved.

AB  - In recent trends due to the increase in rate of petrol and diesel prices biodiesel has been used as an alternate fuel in many of the fast developing countries. However in our country also many research work has been done using different oils. In this paper instead of using a single oil, two different oils was mixed with diesel in different blends and the emissions were calculated and the results were plotted. The two different oils used was the Cashew nutshell liquid (CNSL) and the Rice bran oil. Cashew oil is found to be a by-product which is available from the Cashew industry and after the transesterification process the cardanol obtained was used without any modifications. Rice bran oil is mostly found in the places where rice is grown in a huge quantity and more number of research works has not been done in this oil. By the transesterification process the rice bran oil was prepared and mixed with the CNSL in the different proportions, which was also mixed with diesel in some amounts and the different characteristics were evaluated and plotted. © BEIESP.

AB  - The fundamental goal of the task is to exhibit the aftereffects of the computational liquid elements reproduction of an immediate infusion single chamber motor utilizing diesel, biodiesel, or diverse blend extents of diesel and biodiesel and contrast the outcomes with a proving ground estimation in a similar working point. The motor utilized for checking the consequences of the reproduction is a solitary chamber explore motor from AVL with an open motor control unit, so the infusion timings and amounts can be controlled and broke down. In Romania, until the year 2020 all the fuel stations are obliged to have blends of in any event 10% biodiesel in diesel. The principle points of interest utilizing blends of biofuels in diesel are: the way that biodiesel isn't destructive to the earth; so as to utilize biodiesel in your motor no adjustments are required; the cost of biodiesel is littler than diesel and furthermore on the off chance that we contrast biodiesel creation with the great oil based diesel generation, it is more vitality proficient; biodiesel guarantees more oil to the motor so the life of the motor is expanded; biodiesel is a practical fuel; utilizing biodiesel keeps up nature and it keeps the individuals increasingly solid. © BEIESP.

AB  - The depletion of fossil fuel reserves and increasing demands for diesel are considered to be important triggers for many of the initiatives that have been taken to search for possible sources for the production of biodiesel from materials available within the country. It is possible to produce biodiesel from waste/used cooking oils (WCO) that is comparable in quality to that of fresh vegetable oil. Not only does reuse of WCO, which can otherwise harm human health, reduce the burden on the government of treating oily wastewater, disposing of the waste, and maintaining public sewers, it also significantly lowers the production cost of biodiesel. In the process of frying, oil undergoes many reactions, leading to the formation of a number of undesirable compounds, such as polymers, free fatty acids, and many other chemicals. This poses challenges in the transesterification of WCO. This article covers different techniques in the production of biodiesel from WCO. It also compares combustion, emissions, and engine performance characteristics of biodiesel from WCO as well as factors affecting biodiesel production from WCO and its economic feasibility. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The current work carted out of analysis on the production of fuel from pupae fat extracted from silkworm, and exhaustive investigations were conducted to determine the characteristics of obtained fuel and its blends. The oily organic compounds derived from silkworm is effectively adopted to produce biofuel. The soxhlet extractor is utilized here to separate the oil content from pupae and obtained oil processed into biofuel by undertaking the transesterification process using NaOH as a fast reactive agent along with methanol. The rate of biofuel derived from pupae oil has been noticed to be 65-70 by vol%. The extracted fuels from the transesterification process were mixed with high-speed diesel at a rate of B10, B20, B30 and B40 on volume base. The most important physical and chemical characteristics of generated fuel and their mixture with conventional diesel were examined. The investigation results reveal that the fuel sample B20 satisfies all the requirements of ASTM standards. Pure biofuel shows that the lesser heating value, higher KV, flash point, fire point and density than that of conventional diesel. The blended samples reveal that all the properties are keep moving towards higher value with an increasing percentage of biofuel presence except calorific value. Finally results in evidence that, well suitable biofuel can be generated from organic waste material like silkworm and effectively use it in practical applications. © BEIESP.

AB  - Methanol (CH3OH) and ethanol (C2H5OH) have came to limelight now-a-days because of their property of less polluting emittants and thought of as extremely economical due to its swish operative capacity. Low particulate level and soot free emission can also be obtained due to presence of oxygen in these fuels. We can obtain a considerable fuel efficiency and sound mileage if we double the carbon in ethanol which contains more energy. The structure is more similar to iso-butanol. Iso-butanol is unique in alcoholic fuels due to its equatorial affinity for water. The worldwide energy policy also aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions occurred due to traditional fuels and thus developing renewable energy became an important part of this policy. Now-a-days transport sector has decreased its reliance on oil which generally contributes to hazardous environmental impact and to achieve this some alternative transport fuels such as biofuels, hydrogen and natural gas emerged up as a helping hand. Blending methanol into diesel and gasoline permits the mixture to possess an entire combustion with the presence of oxygen which increases its combustion efficiency and reduces greenhouse gas emission. Gasohol-a blend of gasoline and 10%methanol is available at plenty of petrol service stations as a regular automobile fuel within the United States. Brazil has successfully implemented and used methanol in terms of spark ignition engine operations as a fuel. Methanol has emerged up as a sustainable fuel for IC engines in past few decades because of its characteristics of soot free burning and higher efficiencies at less cost. The European Union decided to set 10% requirement of renewable energy in transport sector which is to be compiled with by 2020. In 2010, the transport sector utilized 4.70% of renewable energy out of which 91% was covered by biofuels. This paper discusses significance of methanol as a fuel for IC engines and its applicability in various sectors. © BEIESP.

AB  - The biofuels are the most important alternative energy sources in future to fulfil the energy demands. The team of our students carried out an innovative process to convert waste to value-added products. The students have been visited many meat stalls and gathered the required amount of resources with and without cost. The collected waste chicken skin and pig tallow is heated and extracted fat, which is the primary sources to produce the biofuel. The fat extraction process was carried by shredding down the waste chicken skin and pig tallow. The obtained fat was filtered and heated up to 110ºC to remove all the impurities, water suspensions, blood cells and pieces of bones. The process called transesterification process was carried out to convert obtained fat into biofuel with methyl alcohol and KOH as a catalyst. Transesterification process carted with fat before acid wash and after acid wash to examine the effect of FFA on biofuel yield. The quantity of biofuel yield has been observed to be 62 to 68% for fat from waste chicken skin and 82 to 83 % for fat from pig tallow. The derived fuel from fat from both resources is combined with conventional diesel fuel to check the different properties on a volume basis varied by 10% up to 40%. The essential properties such as viscosity, density, flashpoint, fire point and calorific values were determined, and results show that the fuel combination CB20 and PB20 meets the all requirements of ASTM standards to fix as an additive fuel to CI engines. The clear biofuel from both the fat expressed higher viscosity, density, flash and fire point with a lesser value of energy density. © BEIESP.

AB  - High resolution computer imaging was developed to evaluate the root dynamics of a biofuel plant—castor bean in a plastic container. Root growth dynamics of the plant was evaluated to determine root and root hair morphology and responses to a particular soil at various time intervals with soil depth. High resolution (2400 picture elements (pixels) cm−1) desktop scanners were buried in containers filled with soil to characterize root and root hair development in every day and after every 7 days. Length from the root tip to the root hair initiation zone, the root hair length (RHL) and root hair diameter (RHD) increased with time and depth. Root development of castor was rapid and extensive compared with shoot growth. Thirty-three days after sowing (DAS) roots of the plant were at least three times as long as the corresponding plant’s shoots. After harvest, roots were washed in water for visualizing actual length. The root hair length (mm) and root hair density (mm−1) was determined for primary axial and lateral roots. The diameter of primary root was higher than the lateral roots and lateral root elongation rate was slower than the primary. This novel approach to in situ rhizosphere imaging allowed observation of an important biofuel plant in root development in response to different soil levels over time and should be useful in future studies of rhizosphere interactions with other biofuel crop establishment and management. This paper therefore describes an automatic method to trace castor bean (Ricinus communis L.) seedling roots grown on soil in a container with high resolution computer imaging technique. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - In the present scenario owing to the depletion of fossil fuel and at the same time increase in demand averts the researchers towards the alternative fuel. Various investigation are being carried out to find the most suitable alternate for the fossil fuel in IC engine, which satisfies the demand, improves the performance and decreases the emission. This paper deals with the multi fuel mode. Tests were performed at 4S mono cylinder dual fuel diesel engine with blends of acetylene in different proportions (0.199 kg/hr., 0.394 kg/hr. and 0.588 kg/hr.) with 20% waste cooking oil at a rated injection pressure of 200bar.The result shows the increased in BTE and deceased BSFC and exhaust gas temperature, furtherance the decrease in NOx and CO are observed as the amount of acetylene increases. BTE increases due to the lower auto ignition temperature and high calorific value of acetylene. Graphs were obtained based on the performance of the engine and B20 with 0.394 kg/hr. of acetylene is concluded to be optimum, B20 with 0.199 kg/hr. of acetylene shows the result similar to diesel operation, at B20 with 0.588 kg/hr. of acetylene increase in the knocking effect was observed. © BEIESP.

AB  - Abstract: This review considers the problems associated with the development and operation of highly active and stable structured catalysts for biogas/biofuel conversion into syngas and hydrogen based on nanocrystalline oxides with fluorite, perovskite, and spinel structures and their nanocomposites promoted by nanoparticles of platinum group metals and alloys based on nickel. The design of these catalysts is based on finding the relationships between the methods of their synthesis, composition, real structure/microstructure, surface properties, and oxygen mobility and reactivity largely determined by the metal–support interaction. This requires the use of modern structural, spectroscopic, kinetic methods, and mathematical modeling. Thin layers of optimized catalysts deposited on structured heat-conducting supports demonstrated high activity and resistance to carbonization in the processes of biogas and biofuels conversion into syngas, and catalysts deposited on asymmetric ceramic membranes with mixed ionic–electronic conductivity allowed oxygen or hydrogen to be separated from complex mixtures with 100% selectivity. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - Global warming and emissions from conventional fuels like diesel and petrol have resulted in a lot of interest towards the use of biofuels. This study focuses on CFD analysis of combustion in a direct injection CI engine fueled by Pongamia biodiesel blend PB20 (80% diesel and 20% Pongamia methyl ester). In order to achieve homogenous charge within the cylinder, the start of injection is advanced from the baseline configuration. Advancement of SOI requires a higher value of EGR in order to compensate NOx emissions. Performance and emission characteristics like ISFC, particulate matter and nitrous oxides have been studied by varying the start of injection timing combined with a fixed amount (50%) of EGR using CONVERGE™ simulation tool. Results have been validated and compared with the standard configuration. Advanced Injection helps in reducing soot which confirms homogenous mixing while the presence of EGR reduces NOx considerably. An optimum start of injection has also been recommended in the present study. © 2018, The National Academy of Sciences, India.

AB  - The present investigation analyzes the performance of a Hatz diesel engine that has 912 cubic centimeters (cc), stationary type, two cylinders, an air cooled feature and B10 (90% diesel and 10% palm biodiesel), using a test bench to improve statistically the repeatability and reproducibility of the runs. The experimental reference tests were carried out under defined conditions at a fixed speed of 1800 revolutions per minute (rpm) and four load levels: 35%, 50%, 65% and 80%. The repeatability analysis was based on the technical standard NTC-ISO / IEC17025. The variables of torque, fuel consumption (FC), air consumption (AC) and exhaust gas temperatures (EGT) showed an increase related with the load increase, showing a lower variation of AC and emissions. With the mechanism's implementation of attenuator of air blows, adjustment mechanism for rpm and preheating air chamber for intake manifold, it was observed that the rpm presented the lowest statistical variability. The variables that presented the highest Pearson correlation with respect to the FC are the CO2, NOX and O2, this is because the engine does not have the Common Rail system, which causes the fuel supply to not be injected accurately and uniformly, therefore the evaluation of performance of the engine could not be repeatable. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Transportation is a vital necessity without which the entire world would come to a standstill. The fossil fuels used to power transportation are consumed at rates of approximately 100,000 times their rate of natural formation, and their consumption subjects the human environment and ecosystem to significant damage. As substitutes for fossil-based diesel, second-generation biodiesels can eliminate many of the challenges concerning first-generation biodiesels in terms of their high cost and the food versus fuel debate. The seeds of the date palm tree have significant oil content and are a promising prospective energy source. This study investigated the potential environmental benefits of this biofuel in terms of diesel tailpipe emission reduction. The various blends of palm date biodiesel were produced and matched to fuel standard requirements, resulting in four standard-compatible blends that were tested in a diesel engine at varying operating conditions for speed and load. Although the biodiesel emissions had lower concentrations of CO2, CO, and HC relative to fossil diesel, higher concentrations of NOx were detected. The results suggest that date-seed biodiesel could become a sustainable energy source for the transport sector, although further technical and economic investigations will be required before its wide deployment. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Brazil is an important player when it comes to biofuel and agricultural production. The knowledge of the price relationship between these markets has increasing importance. This paper adopts several tools, namely the Bai-Perron test of breakpoints, the Johansen cointegration test and the vector error correction model exploited by the orthogonal impulse response and the forecast error variance decomposition, for investigating the price transmission among the ethanol and the main Brazil's agricultural commodities (sugar, cotton, arabica coffee, robusta coffee, live cattle, corn and soybean). The data series cover the period from January 2011 up to December 2018. The results suggest a stronger price transmission from the ethanol commodity to the agricultural commodities, rather than the opposite situation. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Formic acid is a main product from biomass-derived carbohydrates and is attracting ever more attention as a sustainable hydrogen source, owing to its high volumetric hydrogen density of 53 g of H2 per liter. In this review, we give an overview of the formic acid mediated transformations of biomass-based feedstocks into added-value products, including biofuels; attention will be primarily focused on the transformation of biomass-derived platform chemicals, with an emphasis on levulinic acid. Formic-acid mediated lignin depolymerization and biomass-oil upgrading will be also discussed. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Electrification is a frequently discussed solution for reducing transport related carbon dioxide emissions. However, transport sectors such as aviation and heavy-duty vehicles remain dependent on on-board fuels. Here, biomethane is still a little exploited solution, and the case of heavy-duty vehicles is particularly underappreciated despite the recent technical advances and potentially notable emission reductions. This paper discusses the potential of biomethane in heavy-duty road transport in the case of Finland, where the utilization rate is low compared to the technical potential. To this end, the potential of biomethane production through both anaerobic digestion and gasification was calculated in three scenarios for the heavy-duty transport fleet, based on the literature values of biomethane potential and truck class fuel consumption. The authors find that approximately half of the heavy-duty transport in Finland could be biomethane fueled by 2030. The estimated production costs for biomethane (81-190 €/MWh) would be competitive with the current consumer diesel price (152 €/MWh). Utilizing the total biomethane potential in heavy-duty transport would furthermore decrease the respective carbon dioxide emissions by 50%. To accelerate the transition in the heavy-duty transport sector, a more comprehensive political framework is needed, taking into account both production and consumption. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Advances in engineering biology have expanded the list of renewable compounds that can be produced at scale via biological routes from plant biomass. In most cases, these chemical products have not been evaluated for effects on biological systems, defined in the present study as bioactivity, that may be relevant to their manufacture. For sustainable chemical and fuel production, the industry needs to transition from fossil to renewable carbon sources, resulting in unprecedented expansion in the production and environmental distribution of chemicals used in biomanufacturing. Further, although some chemicals have been assessed for mammalian toxicity, environmental and agricultural hazards are largely unknown. We assessed 6 compounds that are representative of the emerging biofuel and bioproduct manufacturing process for their effect on model plants (Arabidopsis thaliana, Sorghum bicolor) and show that several alter plant seedling physiology at submillimolar concentrations. However, these responses change in the presence of individual bacterial species from the A. thaliana root microbiome. We identified 2 individual microbes that change the effect of chemical treatment on root architecture and a pooled microbial community with different effects relative to its constituents individually. The present study indicates that screening industrial chemicals for bioactivity on model organisms in the presence of their microbiomes is important for biologically and ecologically relevant risk analyses.

AB  - Algal systems have been proposed for treating wastewater while simultaneously recovering energy and nutrients. In this study, an integrated system with algal treatment of municipal wastewater followed by hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) conversion and upgrading steps was evaluated. Pilot-scale treatment of primary clarified municipal wastewater effluent was evaluated in different seasons (cold, warm, and a transitional period in between) with different strains of algae selected for each season, and the warm season strain successfully met all local discharge regulations. The collected wastewater algae biomass was subjected to HTL at 300 and 350 °C and both energy and nutrient recoveries were much improved at the higher temperature. The transitional batch was found to have the highest biocrude oil yields, and its co-products had the highest nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) contents. Economic analysis of conversion processes informed by the observed HTL product yields was conducted. While this revealed that targeting biofuel products alone was not profitable, adding nutrient co-products (e.g., ammonium sulfate fertilizer), adjusting algae harvesting time, and incorporating component-specific conversion processes could substantially improve system economics. Overall, this study highlights connections between treatment and conversion processes, and demonstrates how these connections can be leveraged for more efficient resource recovery without compromising treatment operations. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - This research compared the effects of biosurfactant on the biodegradation of biodiesel and vegetable oils while validating two conceptually diverging methodologies. The two experimental setups were successfully modeled towards the effects of biosurfactants during biodegradation. We established the equivalence of both methodologies from the data output. As expected, the biosurfactants caused an increased oil uptake, thus increasing biodegradation performance. Cooking oils were favored by the microbial consortium as a carbon source when compared with biodiesel fuel, especially after use in food preparation. However, we found that biodiesel substrate standout with the highest biodegradation rates. Our results might indicate that a rapid metabolic change from the original compound initially favored biodiesels during the assimilation of organic carbon for a set specialized microbial inoculum. The data output was successfully combined with mathematical models and statistical tools to describe and predict the actual environmental behavior of biodiesel and vegetable oils. The models confirmed and predicted the biodegradation effectiveness with biosurfactants and estimated the required timeframe to achieve satisfactory contaminant removal. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The application of lipases in liquid formulation instead of immobilized forms in the enzymatic biodiesel synthesis can make the process cost-efficient, more competitive, and sustainable. However, despite the benefits, the long reaction times required to achieve satisfactory yields is still a drawback of this biotechnological process. In this sense, employing the novel low-cost soluble NS40116 lipase, this paper proposes an innovative two-step hydroesterification reaction (TSHR) system as a technique of improving the reaction rate of an enzymatic biodiesel production. With the employment of two central composite statistical design to optimize the parameters of each of the reactions involved, the influence of the parameters “water concentration added to the reaction,” “methanol-to-oil molar ratio,” and “lipase load” on the process yield, besides the acid value of the samples, was investigated. After only 8 h of reaction, the highest fatty acid methyl ester yield reached was 97.1% with an acid value of 4.62 mg KOH g−1 utilizing a total of 8 wt% water, methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 6.3:1, and 0.70 wt% of lipase. Furthermore, the statistical models for both reactions indicated to be significant with 95% of reliability. Considering that the papers published using soluble lipases in a one-step batch process normally reach similar yields to those obtained in this research after 16 h to 24 h of reaction, the proposed system demonstrated to be a promising option of process configuration for the enzymatic production of biodiesel. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an important greenhouse gas. Emissions of this gas are generated by the combustion of fossil fuels, mainly in the transportation sector worldwide. Biofuel is a promising alternative instead of diesel considering that it allows a reduction on the emissions of polluting gases. In Brazil, there is a large program on the use of biofuels, which according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reduces greenhouse gas emissions. This work shows the N2O emissions resulting from combustions of diesel/beef tallow biodiesel blends of B7, B15, B20, B25, B35, and B50. In parallel, another experiment was done with fuel sample adopted by a bus fleet from São Paulo using blends comprising 10% of sugarcane diesel in diesel (CD10) and blends with beef tallow biodiesel of CD10: CD-B15, CD-B20, CD-B25, CD-B35, and CD-B50. The photoacoustic spectroscopy technique coupled to a quantum cascade laser (QCL) was used to detect N2O. Concentrations of the emissions were detected in the range of 5.3 to 7.4 ppmv for diesel/beef tallow biodiesel blends combustion and in the range of 4.3 to 11.0 ppmv for diesel/sugar cane diesel/beef tallow biodiesel blends combustion. The technique used was very sensitive and selective to identify and determine the emission concentrations of N2O. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Alternative transportation fuels (ATFs) can reduce air pollution. However, the influence of conventional fuels—diesel and gasoline, and particularly ATFs on photochemical air pollution is not well-characterized, limiting assessments of ATFs and air quality. This is mainly due to frequent use of lumped chemical mechanisms by related atmospheric modeling. Here we hypothesized that applying a chemical mechanism that is specifically developed according to both emission fractions and photochemical ozone creation potential of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is key to gaining reliable insights into the impact of transportation fuels on photochemistry. We used a heterogeneous chemical mechanism with 927 reactions and relatively detailed emission inventories to specifically meet the requirements for reliable simulation of the effect of exhaust emissions from vehicles fueled by selected model fuels—diesel, gasoline, and mixtures of 15% gasoline with 85% ethanol (E85) or 85% methanol (M85)—on photochemistry. These dispersion-box model simulations revealed a strong influence of atmospheric background balance between VOCs and nitrogen oxides (NOX = [NO] + [NO2]) on the impact of exhaust emissions on photochemistry, with higher tendency toward ozone (O3) formation or destruction for more VOC-limited or NOX-limited conditions, respectively. Accordingly, higher [NOX]/[VOC] exhaust emission, such as from diesel and M85, resulted in lower O3, not only locally but also downwind of the emission. This offers a new perspective and measure for transportation fuel assessment. Rapid conversion of O3 to hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl radicals downwind of the exhaust emission indicates the importance of simulating the impact of road transportation on photochemistry at high spatial and temporal resolution. Peroxyacetyl nitrate formation was more sensitive to VOC emission under VOC-limited conditions than to NOX emission under NOX-limited conditions. Secondary formaldehyde dominated over primary emitted formaldehyde several minutes after emission. These findings should be verified using a 3D modeling study under varying meteorological conditions. This study provides new insights into the impact of transportation on photochemical processes, and offers a new perspective and measure for ranking transportation fuels. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bio-oil, produced through fast pyrolysis, can act as an intermediate, which can be further upgraded to biofuels. Fast pyrolysis is done in either a centralized or a decentralized (mobile pyrolysis system [MPS]) system. In a centralized system, biomass is transported to a plant to produce bio-oil, which is upgraded in the same unit, while in a decentralized system, the mobile plant is moved to the forest to produce bio-oil, which is transported to an upgrading facility. The objective of this study is to develop supply chain models and conduct a techno-economic assessment of bio-oil production in these two systems using the developed models. For both systems, the bio-oil plant capacity is considered to be 2000 dry t d−1. Because the capacity of an MPS ranges from 10 to 100 dry t d−1, several mobile pyrolysis units are required to achieve the target bio-oil produced in the base case capacity. In this study, models were developed for each supply chain network allocation scenario/configuration for MPS site location (the radial scenario and the truncated scenario) and four relocation time scenarios were assumed (yearly, semi-annually, quarterly, and monthly). Then, bio-oil production costs were evaluated and compared those with a centralized plant. For a 2000 dry t d−1 biomass plant, bio-oil production costs are 0.241$ L−1, 0.349 $ L−1, and 0.407 $ L−1 for the centralized plant, the MPS truncated scenario (100 dry t d−1 MPS unit, yearly relocation), and the MPS radial scenario (100 dry t d−1 MPS unit, yearly relocation), respectively. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Diesel emissions contain high levels of particulate matter (PM) which can have a severe effect on the airways. Diesel PM can be effectively reduced with the substitution of diesel fuel with a biofuel such as vegetable oil. Unfortunately, very little is known about the cellular effects of these alternative diesel emissions on the airways. The aim of this study was to test whether coconut oil substitution in diesel fuel reduces the adverse effect of diesel emission exposure on human bronchial epithelial cells. Human bronchial epithelial cells were cultured at air-liquid interface for 7 days and exposed to diesel engine emissions from conventional diesel fuel or diesel fuel blended with raw coconut oil at low (10%), moderate (15%) and high (20%) proportions. Cell viability, inflammation, antioxidant production and xenobiotic metabolism were measured. Compared to conventional diesel, low fractional coconut oil substitution (10% and 15%) reduced inflammation and increased antioxidant expression, whereas higher fractional coconut oil (20%) reduced cell viability and increased inflammation. Therefore, cellular responses after exposure to alternative diesel emission are dependent on fuel composition. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In the present scenario, the utilization of petroleum fuel is expanding forcefully worldwide in the vitality store and plays a highly hazardous role in the ecological system. Biofuel stands out among the most tenable keys for this issue. The lemongrass oil is used as a biofuel because of low density and viscosity when compared with diesel. The lemongrass oil is extracted by steam distillation process. In the present investigation, partially stabilized zirconium, due to its higher thermal conductivity, is selected as coating material. The top surface of the piston and the inlet and exhaust valves are coated up to the preferred thickness of 500 μm by the plasma spray technique. The lemongrass emulsion fuel is prepared in the proportion of 94% of lemongrass oil, 5% of water, and 1% of surfactant span 80. The nanoparticles of cerium oxide were used with lemongrass oil (LGO) nano-emulsion in the measurement of 30 ppm. The four-stroke diesel engine execution, ignition, and the outflow extent were contrasted in the diesel and lemongrass oil (LGO) compared with the base diesel engine. The performance characteristic curves of lemongrass-cerium oxide nano-emulsion fuel show the increase in brake thermal efficiency of 17.21% when compared with the mineral diesel fuel. The emission characteristics of lemongrass-cerium oxide nano-emulsion fuel show a drop in hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emission by 16.21% and 15.21%, respectively, when compared with base diesel fuel and also there is a decrease in oxides of nitrogen and smoke emission by 24.1% and 6.3%, respectively, when compared to mineral diesel fuel. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) were measured in 24 h fine particulate matter (PM2.5) samples collected from May 2015 to April 2016 at urban and rural sites in Nanchong, a rapidly urbanized but low-level industrialized city in the Sichuan Basin, China. The annual average PM2.5, OC, and EC concentrations at urban sites were 45.6–55.7, 8.5–11.5, and 2.8–3.4 μg m−3, respectively, which were similar to the corresponding values (48.3, 10.6, and 3.3 μg m−3) at the rural site. The PM2.5 concentrations displayed strong monthly variations, with the highest (78.8–105.0 μg m−3) in January or February. Likewise, daily OC and EC concentrations exhibited high values in October (only for OC) and December 2015 to February 2016. Correlation, positive matrix factorization, and concentration weighted trajectory analyses were combined to investigate the sources of carbonaceous aerosol. The results indicated that OC and EC were mainly from biomass burning (60.7% and 45.8%) and coal combustion (30.2% and 25.7%), followed by vehicle emissions and road dust. The enhanced emissions from residential coal and biofuel uses in winter and straw combustion in October contributed to higher concentrations of OC and EC during these months. The contributions of biomass burning to OC and EC were significantly higher at the rural site (69.2% and 51.8%) than urban sites (56.3–58.6% and 37.8–41.5%). In addition to local emissions, the high concentrations of OC and EC at Nanchong were also influenced by regional transport in the basin. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Carbon dioxide capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) is one of the promising negative emission technologies (NET). Within various CCUS routes available, CO2 conversion into fuels is one of the attractive options. Currently, most of CO2 conversion into fuels requires hydrogen, which is expensive and consume large energy to produce. Hence, a different route of producing fuel from CO2 by utilizing 1,4-butanediol as the raw material is proposed and evaluated in this study. This alternative route comprises production of levulinic acid from the reaction between CO2 and 1,4-butanediol and production of ethyl levulinate, an alternative biofuel and biofuel additive, via an esterification reaction of levulinic acid with ethanol. The process is designed and simulated according to the available data and evaluated in terms of its technical features. Because of the unavailability of reaction data for synthesis of levulinic acid from 1,4-butanediol and CO2, several assumptions were taken, which may implicate the accuracy of the studied design. This technical evaluation is followed by cost estimations and sensitivity analysis. Because of the free CO2, the profitability of the plant depends strongly on the prices of the other chemicals and the price difference between 1,4-butanediol (raw material) and ethyl levulinate (product). Monte Carlo simulation indicates that the proposed plant will always be profitable if the ethyl levulinate is slightly more expensive than the 1,4-butanediol, highlighting that the process of producing ethyl levulinate from CO2 is economically profitable. Future research should be directed towards a catalytic system that can effectively convert CO2 into levulinic acid, by-products produced from the two reaction steps, and reduce the excess ethanol used in the second reaction. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Biodiesel wastewaters contain high amounts of oil, methanol, soap and glycerin. These wastewaters pollutant concentrations as chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), glycerin and MeOH are fluctuating in the ranges of 250,000–450,000 mg/L, 54,000–110,000 mg/L, 800–1,500 mg/L, and 6,000–15,000 mg/L, respectively. Biodiesel wastewaters lead to blockage of oil drainage systems and reduction of biological activity in biological treatment systems. The purpose of this study was to treat wastewater by ozonation after the electrocoagulation process as pre-treatment. In the ozonation process, the initial wastewater pH value was 13.9, ozone dose was 1.5g/L h, reaction time was 7 h and reaction temperature was 45°C. As a result of 7 h of ozonation, 98.64% of COD, 97.48% of TOC and 99.37% of MeOH removal efficiencies achieved. With these results, biodiesel waste water can be discharge to into the receiving environment according to standards. © 2019 Desalination Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - Trade liberalization and globalization processes are resulting in an increased spatial integration of agricultural commodity markets. According to the Heckscher-Ohlin model, land-abundant countries like Ukraine should export land-intensive goods. Therefore, the international integration of commodity markets should lead to the integration of factor markets, land markets among them. Biofuel expansion in the European Union constitutes a chance for a stronger integration of the Ukrainian agricultural market with the European Union market. However, trade policy and biofuel policy modifications create both chances for and threats to strengthening such market integration. In this framework, the present paper aims at assessing—for the first time—to what degree the Ukrainian and European Union rapeseed markets are horizontally integrated. Considering that rapeseed imported to the EU is processed to fulfil the mandatory blending of biofuels with diesel, the Ukrainian rapeseed prices are expected to follow the EU prices. To answer our research question, we employ linear vector error correction models (VECMs) and threshold autoregressive models (TAR) based on weekly prices for rapeseed from 2008–2018. The results confirm direct and indirect integration of both markets via physical trade flows of rapeseeds, rape cake, and rape oil, providing evidence that the prices of rapeseed in Ukraine and European Union are cointegrated and that adjustments to the long-run equilibrium relationship are asymmetric and seasonal. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - New methods of fiber pre-processing and cellulosic fermentation may allow production of isoparaffinic kerosene, a bio-based jet fuel, from abundant post-logging biomass residues in western Oregon and Washington, USA. Since production of these residues is characterized by complex spatial patterns that can shift markedly over time, and since residues may comprise roughly one-fifth of annual refinery operating costs, careful evaluation of residue supply (quantity/price) behavior is warranted. We examine potential residue supply characteristics at two likely refinery sites (Longview, WA and Springfield, OR) using a projection model of the regional log market that explicitly recognizes: (i) spatial locations of harvesting activities, (ii) the transportation network and residue haul costs, and (iii) the underlying conditions of the forest resource that determine harvesting methods and residue collection costs. We find that delivered residue prices in the range of $US64–75/bone dry metric tonne (BDMT) would be required to provide the 771,100 BDMT per year needed by a minimum commercial-sized refinery operation. Timber ownership and spatial harvesting patterns could give the Longview location nearly a $US12/BDMT wood cost advantage over Springfield at this minimum supply level, and operation of the Longview site would limit Springfield's ability to meet the minimum supply volume. Scenario analyses of lower residue collection costs indicate that a 1% reduction in costs could yield 0.6–0.9% increases in delivered supply at both refinery sites in the neighborhood of the minimum scale of commercial operation. Simulations of tripled residue output from federal lands, assuming RIN eligibility, suggest 15–30% increases in delivered residue supply at Springfield but only 0–10% increases at Longview, reflecting greater area and closer proximity of federal lands at Springfield. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Excess carbon footprint is one of the major environmental issues of this decade. Microalgae have emerged as promising biomass feedstock for carbon-neutral fuels as a replacement of fossil-based fuels. Algal biofuels could overcome the shortcomings of first- and second-generation biofuels, mainly completion with food/cash crops and high cost of raw materials. Since the selection of microalgae strain is crucial for product quality, this review provides comprehensive information about the general characteristics of microalgae based on their taxonomic classification. Recent advances in the development of algae biofuels from upstream cultivation to downstream processing are presented. Downstream processing of algae is analysed by providing a deep insight into the techniques applied for biomass pre-treatment, cell disruption, lipid extraction, and product fractionation. The integration of waste bioremediation and biofuels production is also discussed. © 2019

AB  - It is an ideal and sustainable approach to recover renewable energy like biodiesel and to remove organic matters from wastewater simultaneously. However, the common demands of aseptic conditions and long reaction time limit the practical applications of this technology. In this study, lipid production by Rhodosporidium toruloides was investigated using distillery wastewater with an initial soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) of 28,080–17,120 mg/L, an initial cell density of 0.5–2 × 108 cells/mL, and an aeration rate of 0.9–4.5 vvm (air volume/liquid volume/minute) in an open-bubble-column reactor at room temperature. The lipid production reached its peak of 1.92 ± 0.24 g/L in 12 h with a maximum lipid productivity of 160 mg/(L• h) achieved under the conditions: initial SCOD 20,315 mg/L, initial cell density 2 × 108 cells/mL and aeration rate 4 vvm, without external nutrients and sterilization. The associated removal efficiencies for SCOD, total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) were 71.82 ± 0.52%, 79.53 ± 1.77% and 54.39 ± 6.45%, respectively. Both contaminating bacteria and fungi were negligible throughout the cultivation period, suggesting that the studied process has good adaptability to full scale practical applications. © 2019

AB  - This experimental investigation aimed to depict the effects of varying loads at various compression ratios with thumba methyl esters in different proportions as fuel on a variable compression ratio diesel engine. Series of tests were conducted on a single cylinder, 3.6 kW, water cooled, variable compression ratio, stationary diesel engine, as per the full factorial design to measure the performance and emission characteristics. The engine load, compression ratio and blending ratio for citrullus colocynthis (thumba oil) based diesel were taken as input parameters and their effects on engine performance and emissions characteristics such as BTE, BSFC, HC, NOx & CO were investigated experimentally and analytically. Experimental data was analysed and modelled using the full factorial design in three different stages to achieve the optimum results for performance and emission characteristics. For each stage, second order and third order estimate models were developed and were checked for assumptions of Analysis of Variance i.e. normality & homogeneity of data. The optimum performance & emission characteristics were observed with 20% thumba-diesel blend, at a compression ratio of 18 at maximum load. It was found that the optimum values of BSFC, BTE, HC, CO & NOx was 0.456 kg/kWh, 19.725%, 38.432 ppm, 0.026% and 348.744 ppm respectively at load of 10 kg, CR of 18, and blend percentage of 20. A good agreement between experimental results and predication results depicts that the developed models can be used with competence to optimize similar type diesel engine parameters using citrullus colocynthis (thumba oil) blend without engine modification. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Environmental regulations have been increasingly demanding reduction of fossil fuel consumption and emission in industrial activities and in the transportation sector. In this context, the use of biofuels such as ethanol has become increasingly attractive. With similar purpose, several technologies have been explored, among which stands out the pre-chamber ignition system. In this context, this paper aims to evaluate the viability of pre-chamber system use in a commercial SI engine, considering combustion and emission analysis of both homogeneous and stratified with hydrogen injection pre-chamber systems. To conduct this research, a flex-fuel engine under stoichiometric conditions and ethanol as fuel in main chamber was used. In this work it was identified that the use of pre-chambers can reduce the combustion time by up to 20%, increase the thermal efficiency by up to 5% and reduce CO and NOx emissions by up to 12% and 33% respectively, when compared to the baseline ignition system, without significant changes in the combustion efficiency. Moreover, the research proves that output power in stoichiometric mixtures can be increased with the use of both pre-chamber ignition systems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present work deals with the utilization of renewable energy (solar energy) with help of Fresnel lens solar concentrator (FSC) for the esterification of Palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD). In the esterification reaction different reaction parameters like molar ratio, catalyst dosage, stirring speed, addition of molecular sieves and reaction time were studied using one factor at a time approach to get maximum percentage conversion of PFAD. The highest conversion of 96.81% was achieved at a molar ratio of 8:1, catalyst dosage of 1.25 wt %, stirring speed of 200 rpm, reaction temperature of 62 °C, molecular sieves of 6 wt% and reaction time of 30 min under FSC approach. The conventional hotplate heating method was also performed to show the advantage of the FSC method over the conventional method. In the conventional hotplate heating method the maximum conversion of 68.65% was achieved under similar reaction condition as applied for the FSC method. Furthermore, the energy efficiency of the process was also compared. It was found that the FSC method was highly energy efficient than the conventional hotplate heating method for the esterification reaction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fossil fuels are non-renewable resources that will be depleted within the next century, leading to an energy crisis in the near future. Furthermore, there has been a global focus on emissions and its effect on the climate. The aviation sector stands out as a unique sector because a substantial amount of its emissions are injected at cruise altitude giving increased effectiveness to the pollutants. Biofuels (BF) derived from Jatropha and Camelina feedstocks are considered as one of the near-term solutions to the fuel crisis. The objective of this research is to study the effect of using different biofuel blends on gas turbine emissions and performance. These are blended in varying concentrations with conventional Jet-A1 and tested in a can type combustor at two different operating conditions. The performance of the combustor for these blends was evaluated by determining the combustion efficiency, temperature rise, and the emission indices. The general trend observed is that with increasing amounts of Camelina in the blends, there is an appreciable decrease in Carbon Monoxide (CO), Unburnt Hydrocarbons (UHC) and soot. However, the Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) emission increases slightly due to the higher combustion temperatures for Camelina based blends. The Jatropha-based fuels show a mixed trend even though they have comparable properties to the Camelina based fuels. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Although currently microalgae biomass is not considered as a sustainable feedstock for biofuel production, future developments of microalgae cultivation and harvest could make the commercial application of such fast-growing photosynthetic biomass economically and environmentally feasible. This article aims at reviewing thermochemical conversion of microalgae into bio-crude oil through pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction technologies. Subsequently, possible solutions to overcome the constraints to achieve the sustainable conversion of microalgae biomass are discussed in detail. The drawbacks of bio-crude oil as a transportation fuel and the technologies required for its upgrading are highlighted. Currently, microalgae-derived bio-crude oil is inferior to biodiesel and diesel in terms of quality, thus cannot be used as a transportation or jet fuel. It requires catalytic upgrading steps and further processing, including durable and cost-effective catalysts with strong regenerative capabilities. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The transport sector is the second largest energy consumer in Nicaragua, and it relies solely on oil derivatives. It is growing at an unsustainable rate and Nicaragua must explore alternative transport pathways to decarbonize this sector. This study developed 5 scenarios to assess transport alternatives for Nicaragua such as a mass public transport system for the country's capital, the adoption of electric vehicles, and a shift to electrofuels. The scenarios reflect the Nicaraguan energy system in 2030 after the implementation of these alternatives. The results show that stabilizing the transport demand via public transport is a key aspect to achieve decarbonization cost-effectively. Furthermore, the results highlight the direct link between the decarbonization of the transport sector and of the power sector. The adoption of electric vehicles and the production of electrofuels create synergies between the two sectors making them suitable options to integrate higher shares of variable renewable energy in the generation matrix. These synergies increase the overall efficiency of the system and reduce operating costs and CO2 emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuel from bacterial lipids like triacylglycerol (TAG) is known to alleviate difficulties encountered in production of first (1 G), second (2 G) and third generation (3 G) biofuels. Rhodococcus opacus converts glucose into TAG, a biodiesel precursor, by using intermediates in the Kennedy pathway and specific PAP2 enzymes. The elucidation of genes involved, their functions and operational parameters is incomplete. Consequently, we have constructed a PAP2 over-expressing improved variant Rhodococcus opacus BM985 (BM985), optimized and evaluated its parameters for maximizing biodiesel production using synthetic dairy wastewater (SDWW) as the primary medium. Post application of optimization tools, we witnessed an impressive spike in TAG from 34.5% to 68% TAG/dry cell weight (DCW) content in BM985 cells at reactor level – a 1.98-fold increment compared to WT together with a lower BM985 biomass yield (0.76 g/g) but significant biomass concentration (3.7 g/L DCW). BM985 was effective in treating synthetic dairy wastewater with a chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal of ˜88% as compared to 65% by wild-type (WT). The fatty acid compositions obtained and thus the biodiesel properties such as cetane number, iodine number, osmotic stability etc. from BM985 strongly support the potential of BM985 as an alternative source for biofuel production and for DWW treatment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This article presents both an original contribution and a comprehensive technical review of the existing methods of “energy-ecologic efficiency” and “ecological efficiency”. As an original contribution, this work aims at investigating for the first time, through the above-mentioned approaches, power plants fueled by municipal solid waste and hybrids with natural gas. A novel strategy is proposed to solve the main flaws of the existing methods and allow the evaluation of multi-fuel plants in a more practical way. The strategy allows to quantify through a single-score indicator the human health toxicity and climate change potential along with resource depletion due to fuel misuse. It has the advantage of being simple and applicable to any thermal system, allowing quick comparisons between different sources. The major contributions of this work are: (i) to perform a critical analysis, pointing out nuances and limitations of the investigated techniques; (ii) to evaluate systems fueled by urban waste, ranking them among fossil and renewable sources including biomass, biofuel and natural gas; (iii) to study the influence of emission abatement and biogenic carbon offset due to biomass regrowth regarding waste fired plants. As unique findings of this research, are shown the advantages of using urban waste as fuel integrated to gas turbines in combined cycles as an alternative to conventional single-fueled waste-to-energy plants, namely: (i) hybrid plants perform 12–24% better than single-fueled plants; (ii) the only way a single-fueled plant can overcome a hybrid plant is if it performs co-generation with a thermal efficiency 27% superior. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Carbohydrate-rich and fast-growing seaweeds such as the S. japonica species are increasingly becoming the 3rd generation biomass of choice. Environmentally friendly as well as economically sound processes for biofuel production are essential if the benefits of these novel marine feedstocks are to be harnessed. This study features an experiment-based process design that combines a fluidized bed fast pyrolysis reactor system, non-intensive pretreatment, and a Bryton power cycle in an, energy-wise, nearly self-sustainable system, considerably reducing the utilization of fossil fuel-derived utilities. Complex liquid products of pyrolysis and catalytic upgrading were modeled using a specialized software ensuring strict adherence to experimental data, hence retaining a highly realistic simulation. Results of comprehensive techno-economic and market uncertainty assessments have shown a capital investment of 170 mil. USD, and a minimum selling price range of 1.534–1.852 USD/L. When compared to traditional oil and gas extraction and refining processes, the designed process yielded a 12.8-fold reduction of the total CO2 emitted, indicating a superior process in terms of environmental sustainability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel was synthesized from Schizochitrium limacinum microalgae with different methylating agents namely, methanol, dimethyl carbonate and methyl acetate. The reactions were conducted at 518–643 K at 20 MPa and methylating agent to algae ratio at 10:1. The reaction time was varied between 10 and 80 min. Conversions of >90% was observed within 40 min at 543 K for methanol system. However, the conversions were considerably lower for other systems and only 50% was observed with dimethyl carbonate after 30 min at 643 K, and 40% conversion with methyl acetate after 40 min at 643 K. The rate constants were obtained by pseudo-first order kinetic model. Based on the variation of rate constants with temperature, Arrhenius equation was used to determine the activation energy of all the three reaction systems. The reaction rates were the highest and lowest for the reaction with methanol and methyl acetate, respectively. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study investigated the effect of monochromatic light-emitting diodes (LEDs) on the growth and biodiesel yield of the green microalga Scenedesmus obliquus. Different LEDs were applied individually or in combination during the night period. Among different individual treatments, red and blue illumination showed the highest biomass and lipid productivity due to stimulation of pigmentation and photosystem II, respectively. Microalgal growth, lipid production and biodiesel recovery significantly increased under combined blue-red illumination. In addition, saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids proportions increased in favor of polyunsaturated ones. Moreover, blue-red LEDs enhanced the net biodiesel energy output over the control. The total increase in net energy output represented 5.1, 3.8 and 10.8 MJ using red, blue and blue-red light, respectively. In conclusion, application of blue-red LEDs during the night period is an economical technology for microalgae cultivation, which might have a potential impact on the future of commercial biodiesel production from microalgae. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Two individual chains of microalgae-to-diesel and microalgae-to-butanol were upgraded through process integration and design. According to life cycle assessment (LCA)standards, the two proposed chains were compared in terms of 17 categories of LCA impacts and the sensitivity analysis of LCA impacts on two chains with different lipid or carbohydrate content of microalgae cells was performed. Based on the prescribed specifications and conditions for microalgae cultivation, pretreatment and purity level of the products, LCA analysis revealed that the annual ReCiPe end point score of producing 1 kg biobutanol is lower than that of 1 kg biodiesel by 54.4%. The upgraded microalgae-to-butanol chain could reduce the annual ReCiPe end point score of producing 100 MJ diesel/gasoline from crude oil by 5–10%. The microalgae-to-butanol chain is more ecofriendly than the microalgae-to-diesel chain due to lower LCA impacts such as Climate change human health, Climate change ecosystems, and Fossil depletion. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Renewable energy sources can help combat climate change but knowing the land, water and carbon implications of different renewable energy production mixes becomes a key. This paper systematically applies land, water and carbon footprint accounting methods to calculate resource appropriation and CO2eq GHG emissions of two energy scenarios. The ‘100% scenario’ is meant as a thinking exercise and assumes a complete transition towards bioenergy, mostly as bioelectricity and some first-generation biofuel. The ‘SDS-bio scenario’ is inspired by IEA's sustainable development scenario and assumes a 9.8% share of bioenergy in the final mix, with a high share of first-generation biofuel. Energy inputs into production are calculated by differentiating inputs into fuel versus electricity and exclude fossil fuels used for non-energy purposes. Results suggest that both scenarios can lead to emission savings, but at a high cost of land and water resources. A 100% shift to bioenergy is not possible from water and land perspectives. The SDS-bio scenario, when using the most efficient feedstocks (sugar beet and sugarcane), would still require 11–14% of the global arable land and a water flow equivalent to 18–25% of the current water footprint of humanity. In comparative terms, using sugar or starchy crops to produce bioenergy results in smaller footprints than using oil-bearing crops. Regardless of the choice of crop, converting the biomass to combined heat and power results in smaller land, water and carbon footprints per unit of energy than when converting to electricity alone or liquid biofuel. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - This study presents a life cycle greenhouse gas and energy assessment for two algal biofuel production pathways: biodiesel produced through lipid extraction (LE) and renewable diesel produced through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). The two production pathways generate different co-products, which are handled through allocation in life cycle assessment-based analyses. The method and assumptions used for co-product allocation affect the performance of the analyzed fuels, and are thus examined through scenario analysis; five co-product allocation strategies are tested for the LE pathway and six are tested for the HTL pathway. After allocation, the carbon intensity of renewable diesel varies from 36 to 54 gCO2e/MJ, and the primary energy consumption of renewable diesel varies from 0.7 to 1.2 MJ/MJ; while the carbon intensity of biodiesel ranges, remarkably, from −59 to 125 gCO2e/MJ, and the primary energy consumption of biodiesel ranges from 0.1 to 1.7 MJ/MJ. The optimal algal oil production pathway is determined by comparing open-loop and closed-loop systems, considering not only the estimated net environmental impacts, but also the confidence or uncertainty of those outcomes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In recent years, there has been a strong global interest in developing technologies for converting renewable and low-cost raw materials into green diesel and bio-jet fuel, which are made of hydrocarbons. In this work, cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL), which is an industrial waste, was used as a feedstock to produce green diesel. Different reaction conditions during the upgrading process (deoxygenation, hydrogenation and cracking) were evaluated using palladium over activated charcoal (Pd/C) as a catalyst. The catalyst was characterized by X-ray diffraction and specific surface area analysis. The influences of the reaction parameters, such as temperature (180, 250 and 300 °C), time (5 and 10 h) and pressure (10, 20, 30 and 40 bar), were investigated using 10% w/w Pd/C. The composition of the products was determined using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy. Higher pressures and temperatures led to a higher degree of deoxygenation and hydrogenation. In contrast, lower pressures or temperatures resulted in higher degrees of cracking. From the optimization experiments, a 98% yield of hydrocarbons corresponding to the diesel range was obtained under a 40 bar H2 atmosphere at 300 °C, 10 h, and 500 rpm (in a batch reactor). Of these hydrocarbons, 89% were saturated alkanes, 3% were aromatic compounds and 6% were oxygenated compounds. This new and sustainable route is promising because it involves the conversion of a low-value residue into green diesel using mild experimental conditions. Biofuel production from CNSL allows the total valorization of the residues in the cashew-nut agroindustrial chain and has potential industrial applications in many countries. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Since the Kyoto protocol, the EU renewable energy policy has been the driving force in research and development of the production and use of biofuels. Therefore, the utilization of biofuels and the scientific research to widen the scope of their commercialization are being increasingly promoted. In this context, we present here an overview of the technological developments that have occurred in the production of different biofuels and their resources with a focus on the lignocellulosic biomass and biofuels derived from it. In the recent years, many technologies have evolved enabling the production of different liquid biofuels from lignocellulosic biomass. Bioethanol production using microbial fermentation, and production of bio-oil using fast pyrolysis process of biomass are some of the most widely researched and promising technologies. The first production plants based on these techniques are already operational. Bioethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass promises a good fuel yield under laboratory scale. However, there are several challenges that need to be tackled before the production process can be commercialized. We provide here an overview of the various possibilities that can be exploited for biofuel production and make recommendations for increasing the production efficiency with a view to improving the overall yield and lowering the production costs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, Anabaena PCC 7120 microalgae is used as feedstock for biodiesel synthesis. Anabaena 7120 was cultivated in a closed photobioreactor. Oil was extracted by cell disruption process and purified by degumming process. Anabaena oil was characterized by GCMS spectroscopy. Barium titanium oxide (Ba2TiO4)heterogeneous catalyst was prepared by wet impregnation process and characterized through various techniques such as TGA, XRD, FTIR, HR-SEM, EDX and surface area analyzer. Basicity of synthesized catalyst was calculated by Hammett indicator titration method. The synthesized Ba2TiO4 was used in transesterification of Anabaena oil for biodiesel production and it was reused up to six cycles. The highest FAME conversion from anabaena oil was found to be 98.41% under optimized condition of 1:18 M ratio (oil:methanol), 3.5 wt% of catalyst loading and 180 min of reaction time at 65 °C temperature and 400 rpm stirring speed. © 2019

AB  - Research into the potential use of microalgae to produce biofuels is receiving significant attention. In the cold climates of countries like Canada, algae cultivation in open raceway pond (ORP) systems is limited to a short period of the year when pond surface water temperatures and ambient light conditions enable optimal culture growth. In this study we develop techno-economic assessment models to predict, evaluate, and compare the techno-economic results from three autotrophic algae cultivation scenarios to produce algae biomass. The first is a modeled ORP site located in the southern USA, which has a minimum biomass selling price (MBSP) for algae of $541 tonne−1 (T−1). The second scenario models an identical ORP system co-located at a site near Fort Saskatchewan, a northern city in the province of Alberta, Canada. The resulting MBSP is $1288 T−1. A third scenario models a photobioreactor (PBR) cultivation system co-located at the same northern Alberta site and shows algae production with an MBSP of $550 T−1. Each system is scaled to produce 2000 T day−1 ash-free dry weight (AFDE) algae biomass. The study concludes that PBR systems deployed at this scale have the potential to reduce production costs significantly ($ T−1) compared to similarly sited ORP systems in Canada, despite climatic factors and high initial capital costs associated with PBR construction. Furthermore, the modeled PBR system required 0.3% of the water required by the ORP cultivation platforms (153 × 103 versus 59 527 × 103 m3) and 0.04% of the land (32 versus. 82 038 ha). © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - A trade-off inevitably exists between soot and NOX emissions in a traditional engine. The addition of an oxygen-containing biofuel can decrease the soot emission but increase the NOX emission. Multi-injection strategy can be used to decrease the NOX emission. Therefore, both simulations and experimental tests were conducted to evaluate the influences of pre-injection on the combustion and emission characteristics of pure diesel (D100)and diesel/n-butanol (30% n-butanol and 70% diesel by volume, B30). The results showed that as the pre-injection interval decreased, the in-cylinder pressure peak increased, the pre-injection heat release ratio increased, and the brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC)decreased. Only at a small pre-injection interval, the BSFC under pre-injection condition was lower than that obtained using the single injection strategy. When the same pre-injection strategy was used, B30 had a higher BSFC and lower brake thermal efficiency than D100. The soot emission decreased with the increase in pre-injection interval but increased with the increase in pre-injection ratio. More soot was emitted using the pre-injection strategy than that using single injection strategy. B30 had a lower soot emission than D100 due to a longer ignition delay. As the pre-injection interval increased, the decreasing amplitude of NO production became smaller than the increasing amplitude of NO2 production, thus increasing the net NOX emission. As the pre-injection ratio increased, more CO was produced through the reaction paths CH2O → HCO → CO, whereas the transformation of CO to CO2 almost remained unchanged, thus increasing the net CO emission. The increase in pre-injection ratio inhibited the oxidation of CO to CO2 and thus increased the CO emission. The amount of unburned hydrocarbons increased with the increase in both pre-injection ratio and interval. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper is primarily a case study on transesterification of avocado oil for the synthesis of biodiesel. Many operational parameters and components were studied in an attempt to identify the optimal process for non-catalytic transesterification, and dimethyl carbonate (DMC), an acyl acceptor was identified as key to one very efficient methodology. Non-catalytic transesterification experiments using DMC and/or methanol (MeOH) were conducted under varied temperatures and varied amounts of silica loading. The maximum yield of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) of 92.96% was shown to be achievable at 380 °C. The miscibility of avocado oil and DMC was seen to be a key factor in providing a strategic means for delaying thermal cracking of FAMEs. Lastly, this study reported that the optimal mass ratio of silica to oil was over 8 at 380 °C. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Sustainable biofuel supply chain is a key to sustainable manufacturing and the future of production. Greener production is now becoming an order qualifier for the global competition. Modeling biofuel supply chains that achieve economic, social, and environmental feasibility is a challenge. This article develops biofuel platform planning and optimization that unifies biofuel product, production process and networks design into an umbrella of sustainable supply chain planning. A design of biofuel supply chain networks under various production paths is considered. The modeling results show that an optimum region of composition ratio between rice straws and waste cooking oils can be set within the range from 0% to 50%. Bio-diesel is favored over ethanol by occupying over 40% of the total biofuel outputs. However, ethanol yield is 99.1% and therefore it is sufficient to be directly mixed with gasoline at final depots. In terms of social contribution, it is estimated that the supply chain contribution to the case country GDP is about 0.17%. Looking at the above statistics, future research on global economic impacts and competitiveness of biofuel production is suggested. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, catalytic and non-catalytic pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis of pretreated and intact sugarcane bagasse was investigated using waste heavy paraffin (as an in-situ supply of hydrogen). A Y-type commercial zeolite catalyst (HGY-A) which is a gasoline boosting catalyst suitable for hydrocracking reactions in oil refining was used for catalytic pyrolysis. Co-feeding of bagasse with paraffin produced higher liquid product yields and lower solid yields. The improved effective hydrogen to carbon ratio (H/Ceff) of the feedstock, and primary cracking and fragmentation reactions of heavy paraffin at temperatures around 600 °C are responsible for considerable improvement of bio-oil yield. Use of HGY-A catalyst did change the composition of the produced bio-oil; however, it did not have any appreciable impact on the bio-oil yield under various operational conditions. Results showed that acidic pretreatment of bagasse (with a 30% w/w HCl) reduced the bio-oil yield and increased the char yield. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The objective of this research was to develop a direct artificial neural network with the ability to predict a corrosion rate of metals in different biodiesel. Experimental values were obtained by the electrochemical noise technique, EN, as well as, information reported in the literature. A backpropagation model was proposed with three layers; metal and biodiesel composition, blend biodiesel/diesel, total acid number (TAN), temperature and exposure time were considered as input variables in the model. The best fitting training data were acquired with 24:4:1, considering a Levenberg –Marquardt learning algorithm, a hyperbolic tangent and linear transfer functions in the hidden and output layer respectively. Experimental and simulated data were compared satisfactorily through the linear regression model with a correlation coefficient of 0.9885 and a mean square error, MSE, of 2.15 × 10−4 in the validation stage. Furthermore, the model agreed the requirements of the slope and the intercept statistical test with a 99% confidence. The obtained results indicated that the ANN model could be attractive as corrosion rate estimator. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Application of biodiesel is very important for reducing the consumption of fossil fuels and improving emissions performance of internal combustion engines in the transportation field. Hydrogenated catalytic biodiesel has attracted more attention due to the high quality and eco-friendly nature. Hence, in order to provide more fundamental data for applying this biodiesel in engines, the spray liquid length, ignition and combustion characteristics for both diesel and hydrogenated catalytic biodiesel has been researched in a constant volume combustion chamber to see their differences and similarities, which can be used for determination of the possible proportion of hydrogenated catalytic biodiesel in blends for further research in engines. The results show that the spray liquid length of hydrogenated catalytic biodiesel is shorter than that of diesel fuel, which indicates that hydrogenated catalytic biodiesel has better atomization and less chance for occurrence of wall-impingement. While a shorter ignition delay of hydrogenated catalytic biodiesel reveals that it cannot be applied in blends with a large proportion due to knocking combustion. However, a shorter ignition delay of hydrogenated catalytic biodiesel means that it is a highly active fuel which can be used to engines as a blend for new advanced combustion modes. The lift-off lengths were compared with different optical methodologies. Lift-off length is more sensitive to fuel properties rather than temperature under low ambient temperature conditions. The relationships between spray liquid length and lift-off length and between ignition delay and lift-off length were also compared. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work deals with the optimization and enzyme reuse of lipase-catalyzed transesterification of low quality fish oil, as an environmentally friendly alternative for the biodiesel production. Three commercial immobilized enzymes, Lipozyme RM IM, Lipozyme TL IM and Novozym 435, which possess different specificity and resistance to alcohol inhibition, were employed using ethanol as acyl acceptor. For any of the lipases, the maximum yield was around 75 wt% after 8 h of reaction and 50 wt% of enzyme loading, but different ethanol to oil ratio were required. The response surface models obtained explained more than the 92% of the data, and were employed to reach optimal conditions. Maximum FAEE yield (82.91 wt%) was obtained using Novozym 435 and an excess of EtOH (1.82 g per g of oil). The reusability of the immobilized lipases was evaluated under the optimal conditions. It was found that Novozym 435 can be used for 10 consecutive cycles, with a maximum loss of activity of 16%, whereas Lipozyme RM IM and Lipozyme TL IM experienced more significant losses. An exponential model to predict and compare lipase behaviors towards several reusing cycles was proposed and validated towards the experimental data, thus simplifying the scaling up of processes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is an important biofuel which has attracted attention because it can partially or totally replace petrodiesel fuel. Based on environmental, economic and social issues, government policy in many countries has mandated the addition of biodiesel to petrodiesel fuel, promoting the use of diesel/biodiesel blends. In this context, we evaluated the molecular interactions between native diesel molecules (n-paraffins, isoparaffins, naphthenes, aromatics, and heteroatomics) and four different methyl esters (from stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic acid), the most representative biodiesel molecules. We applied Molecular Dynamic simulations to obtain a detailed picture of the interactions and to quantitatively compute the accumulation of diesel molecules around the methyl esters by distribution functions. The results revealed that the diesel molecules accumulated around the fatty acid methyl esters at a distance of about 2.2 Å due to the non-polar interactions as well as at approximately 1.8 Å as a result of the hydrogen bonds formed between carbazole and esters. The data also demonstrated that the ester molecules diffuse into the blends less than the diesel molecules. In summary, the present investigation contributes to the fundamental understanding of the interactions between biodiesel and diesel molecules, revealing the arrangement and behavior of the diesel and biodiesel molecules in the diesel/biodiesel fuel blend. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The use of high viscosity biodiesel resulted in poor fuel injection pump performance, leading to a decrease in diesel engine performance. This problem is expected to be solved by preheating high-viscosity fuel. This study aims to investigate effect of preheating temperature of biodiesel-diesel fuel blends on fuel spray characteristic and injection pump performance. The study was conducted by using a fuel injection system apparatus in which the fuel was supplied into an injector using a single-plunger fuel injection pump. Several biodiesel-diesel blends were tested at preheating temperatures of 30 °C–70 °C. Fuel spray pattern was taken using a high speed camera. The result showed that preheating temperature highly influenced fuel spray characteristic and injection pump performance. The higher the biodiesel-diesel fuel blends, the higher the preheating temperatures were needed. Injection pump and injector required different fuel preheating temperatures for obtaining better performance. For B100, the best conditions were obtained at 50 °C for injection pump and 70 °C for fuel injector that produce almost similar pump efficiency and fuel spray cone angle to diesel fuel. As a whole, a new option of fuel supply system for biodiesel and blends was proposed in order to overcome the transport difficulty of high viscosity fuels. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An analysis of the toxic effects of emissions should reflect real traffic conditions. The exhaust emissions of particulate matter from diesel engines strongly depend on their operating conditions, with low-speed, low-load “urban creep” conditions, common for truck traffic in heavily congested urban areas, being one of the worst. We aimed to detect the genotoxicity of organic extracts from particulate matter in the exhaust of the diesel engine Zetor 1505 running on diesel and biodiesel (B100) fuels at characteristic modes of extended "urban creep", typical for transit truck traffic in Prague, comparing the first 5 min of idling with extended (20–80 min) idling, full load after idle, “stabilized” full load, and 30% load. The diluted exhaust was sampled with high volume samplers on glass fiber fluorocarbon coated filters. The filters were extracted with dichloromethane and DNA damage was analyzed in A549 cells using comet assay, with the inclusion of formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (FPG) and endonuclease III (ENDOIII) to recognize oxidized DNA bases. The cells were exposed to extractable organic matter (EOM) for 4 and 24 h at non-cytotoxic dose corresponding to 0.001 m3 of undiluted exhaust gas per ml cell media. At the 4 h exposure interval, all samples from B100 and diesel emissions induced DNA damage. EOM from the extended idle engine mode exerted the strongest genotoxic effect for both fuels. Twenty hours later, the cells exposed to diesel EOM exhibited a further increase of DNA strand breaks compared to the preceding interval. In contrast, DNA damage seemed to be fully repaired in cells treated with EOM derived from biodiesel B100. The preliminary results suggest that (i) diesel emissions are more genotoxic than the emissions from B100, (ii) biodiesel induced DNA lesions are repaired within 24 h. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study investigated the impact of the addition of a novel series of biodiesels on diesel engine performance, emissions and combustion characteristics. Two non-edible biodiesels, namely waste cooking oil and macadamia oil (Macadamia integrifolia) biodiesels were experimentally tested in this study. The fuel blends were prepared in such a way that the fuel oxygen remains at 3.35 wt% in the blend. A 4-stroke, 4-cylinder, naturally aspirated diesel engine was used for all experiments. The engine was coupled and loaded with an eddy current dynamometer. The experimental results indicated that compared to diesel, all diesel-biodiesel blends show no significant changes in engine performance, but higher combustion efficiency and significant reductions in all major diesel emissions with a little penalty of NOx emission. Fuel energy and exergys were almost unchanged or slightly lower than diesel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recent developments in nano additives focuses on lowering the diesel engine exhaust emissions. While the usage of biodiesel in diesel engine at lower blend percentage (10%–30%) with mineral diesel can be well utilized without any engine modifications, the main striking factor in biodiesel application in diesel engine is higher NOx formation due to excess in-built O2, which could be overcome with the usage of EGR (exhaust gas recirculation). However, EGR usage raises the concerns of HC, CO and smoke emissions. Overcoming the above existing problem, the current research proposal focuses on EGR of B30 (30% palm biodiesel-70%diesel) blended with 25 ppm TiO2 nanoparticles (PBN). Experimental test results obtained for PBN-EGR were outstanding than the conventional PB-EGR system since there is a noticeable drop in BSFC, HC and CO emissions with increase in EGT (exhaust gas temperature) than PBN. NOx emissions of PBN-EGR were on par with PB-EGR throughout the load. At higher engine loads, smoke emitted by PBN-EGR were lower than PB-EGR. With increase in EGR percentage in PBN, cylinder pressure was only marginally lower and heat release rate was higher than PBN. The present investigation enumerates that the synergic effect of nanoparticle, biodiesel and EGR is effective in improving the performance with minimized exhaust emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Nowadays, rapid increase in vehicle population led to increase in demand of fossil fuel. Decrease in availability of crude oil made the researchers to find a renewable alternative fuel, biofuels. Methyl esters are preferred as alternative to petro-diesel engines. The present experimental study of Mimusops elangi methyl ester (MEME) is used as biodiesel on single cylinder four stroke, direct injection air cooled diesel engine at a constant speed of 1500 rpm at various loads. The general optimum biodiesel blends 20MEME-80D (20%MEME-80%Diesel) with optimum of 25 ppm TiO2 nanoparticle additives were taken for the experiment. The injection pressure of the engine is varied from 180 bar to 240 bar in the steps of 20 bar. The results of experimental investigation reported that the change in injection pressure 220 bar with modified fuel (20MEME-80D + 25 ppm TiO2 nanoparticle) shows better performance and emission characteristics in the diesel engine. © 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 38:e13146, 2019. © 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - The foremost purpose of this techno-economic analysis (TEA) modeling was to predict a harmonized figure of comprehensive cost analysis for commercial bioethanol generation from microalgae species in Brunei Darussalam based on the conventional market scenario. This model was simulated to set out economic feasibility and probabilistic assumption for large-scale implementations of a tropical microalgae species, Chlorella vulgaris, for a bioethanol plant located in the coastal area of Brunei Darussalam. Two types of cultivation systems such as closed system (photobioreactor—PBR) and open pond approaches were anticipated for a total approximate biomass of 220 t year−1 on 6 ha coastal areas. The biomass productivity was 56 t ha−1 for PBR and 28 t ha−1 for pond annually. The plant output was 58.90 m3 ha−1 for PBR and 24.9 m3 ha−1 for pond annually. The total bioethanol output of the plant was 57,087.58 gal year−1 along with the value added by-products (crude bio-liquid and slurry cake). The total production cost of this project was US$2.22 million for bioethanol from microalgae and total bioethanol selling price was US$2.87 million along with the by-product sale price of US$1.6 million. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to forecast the uncertainty of this conclusive modeling. Different data sets through sensitivity analysis also presented positive impacts of economical and environmental views. This TEA model is expected to be initialized to determine an alternative energy and also minimize environmental pollution. With this current modeling, microalgal-bioethanol utilization mandated with gasoline as well as microalgae cultivation, biofuel production integrated with existing complementary industries, are strongly recommended for future applications. © 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 38:e13146, 2019. © 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - In today’s technology age, especially in urban areas, one of the most important sources of environmental noise pollution is diesel engines. Due to the limited availability of petroleum-based fuels, produced in only certain regions of the world maps, high cost, and being one of the most important causes of environmental pollution, in recent years, researchers have intensively focused on the study of alternative energy sources. Today, one of the most important alternative energy sources is biodiesel obtained from various natural sources. In this study, the effect of broiler chicken and turkey biodiesel on the noise emission of diesel engines was investigated experimentally. The biodiesels were produced with special methods using broiler chicken and turkey rendering fats. Two different kinds of biodiesels were homogeneously blended into the diesel fuel at proportions of 10%, 20%, and 50%. Engine tests were carried out at full load at various engine speeds and partial loads at a constant speed of 2000 rpm. During the experiments, noise measurements of the engine were taken by hand-held noise analyser. For more detailed assessment, 1/3 octave band noise analysis between 10 and 10 kHz was performed as well. Compared with diesel fuel, results of the noise analyses showed that use of biodiesel blends produced from broiler chicken and turkey rendering fat in diesel fuel has no significantly effect on engine noise emissions. Biodiesels produced from broiler chicken and turkey fats can be used safely in terms of noise emissions as engine fuels. © 2018, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - The requirement for sustainable development has prompted the researchers to explore solutions for better utilization of renewable energy resources in the future. Biomass is a promising resource and it can be converted to multiple products and services including fuels, chemicals, heat and electricity via different conversion routes. Hence, replacement of fossil-based services with biomass-based services is critical to mitigate fossil CO2 emissions, and innovative design of new and efficient energy conversion systems is necessary. Different industries need heat for their operations at different temperature levels. Today, these demands are satisfied using conventional natural gas boilers by imposing a CO2 tax to account for their emissions. In this study, we discuss the potential of replacing conventional boilers with a combined heat and fuel (CHF) plant design which utilizes lignocellulosic biomass in thermochemical conversion to generate heat for different industrial sectors together with biofuels cogeneration. Heat is generated due to the exothermic nature of the thermochemical conversion processes that operate at high temperatures. Gasification process produces syngas which is converted into fuels such as synthetic natural gas, Fischer-Tropsch crude, methanol and dimethyl ether and electricity. Different scenarios are evaluated considering the CO2 produced via this system is either released, sequestrated, or stored and used in a co-electrolysis unit in which surplus renewable electricity available during summer is converted into additional syngas. A parametric analysis has been performed considering type and size of plants, CO2 tax, and purchase and transportation costs of wood to compare the price of heat for the industrial sectors. Natural gas and wood boilers are used as the basis to calculate the breakeven CO2 tax values for the same heat prices for the proposed CHF systems. The results of this study present a state-of-the-art renewable energy system as an alternative to conventional boilers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The primary goal of this project was to evaluate the performance of the Standard and Enforced Geometry Optimization (SEGO) method which we have recently developed. The SEGO method has been designed for an automatic location of multiple minima on the molecular Potential Energy Surface (PES), and its usefulness has been demonstrated so far for three molecules only. In this project we applied the SEGO method to explore the 2-methylfuran (2MF) PES. Our choice was not accidental: this molecule recently gained a great deal of interest as a potential candidate for biofuel, and therefore its pyrolysis is extensively studied. To understand pyrolysis of 2MF a detailed knowledge about its PES is needed. In these studies we explored the 2MF PES and located a surprisingly large number of local minima corresponding to 2MF isomers and decomposition products. Some of the 2MF isomers and fragments have amazing structures which most likely were previously unknown. All structures presented in this paper were found in an automatic manner as a result of the enforced chemical reactions driven by the SEGO method. Thus, in these studies we have not only proven that the SEGO method is a very efficient tool for exploring molecular potential energy surfaces, but we also obtained very detailed knowledge about the 2MF PES. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: Oleaginous yeasts are potent hosts for the renewable production of lipids and harbor great potential for derived products, such as biofuels. Several promising processes have been described that produce hydrocarbon drop-in biofuels based on fatty acid decarboxylation and fatty aldehyde decarbonylation. Unfortunately, besides fatty aldehyde toxicity and high reactivity, the most investigated enzyme, aldehyde-deformylating oxygenase, shows unfavorable catalytic properties which hindered high yields in previous metabolic engineering approaches. Results: To demonstrate an alternative alkane production pathway for oleaginous yeasts, we describe the production of diesel-like, odd-chain alkanes and alkenes, by heterologously expressing a recently discovered light-driven oxidase from Chlorella variabilis (CvFAP) in Yarrowia lipolytica. Initial experiments showed that only strains engineered to have an increased pool of free fatty acids were susceptible to sufficient decarboxylation. Providing these strains with glucose and light in a synthetic medium resulted in titers of 10.9 mg/L of hydrocarbons. Using custom 3D printed labware for lighting bioreactors, and an automated pulsed glycerol fed-batch strategy, intracellular titers of 58.7 mg/L were achieved. The production of odd-numbered alkanes and alkenes with a length of 17 and 15 carbons shown in previous studies could be confirmed. Conclusions: Oleaginous yeasts such as Yarrowia lipolytica can transform renewable resources such as glycerol into fatty acids and lipids. By heterologously expressing a fatty acid photodecarboxylase from the algae Chlorella variabilis hydrocarbons were produced in several scales from microwell plate to 400 mL bioreactors. The lighting turned out to be a crucial factor in terms of growth and hydrocarbon production, therefore, the evaluation of different conditions was an important step towards a tailor-made process. In general, the developed bioprocess shows a route to the renewable production of hydrocarbons for a variety of applications ranging from being substrates for further enzymatic or chemical modification or as a drop-in biofuel blend. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - The present study aims to reduce carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emission from a CI engine using calcite/activated carbon-based post-combustion CO 2 capture system fueled with Calophyllum inophyllum biodiesel (B100). The tests were conducted in a two-cylinder CI engine used in tractors at different load conditions. The performance and emission parameters of diesel and B100 with and without calcite and activated carbon-based CO 2 capture system were studied. The results show that compared to diesel, CO 2 emission increased by 19% for B100 due to high fuel-bound oxygen and carbon. Higher NO emission with a slightly reduced smoke opacity is observed with B100 combustion. CO 2 emission is reduced with the CO 2 capture system for both diesel and B100. CO 2 emission is reduced by 11.5% and 7.3% for diesel with calcite and activated carbon, respectively, and reduced by 15.8% and 10.5% for B100 with calcite and activated carbon. Due to the adsorption capacity of both calcite and activated carbon, NO and smoke opacity are reduced considerably. The results display that calcite is better in reducing CO 2 compared to activated carbon-based CO 2 capture system. It is perceived that the combination of biofuel and calcite-based CO 2 capture system can both reduce engine-out emissions and cause a net negative CO 2 emission as it is renewable aiding in mitigation of global warming effects. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In this experiment, the performance, emission, and combustion characteristics of a diesel engine were tested using bio-fuel (Anise oil) at different loads. The main focus of this study was to compare the existing biodiesel blends with the proposed mixture (anise + cerium oxide) of biodiesel blends in terms of engine parameters, cost, efficiency, and pollution control. The blends used in this experiment are B10 (Biodiesel-10%), B20 (Biodiesel-20%), and B30 (Biodiesel-30%). The emission and performance parameters considered for the test are SFC (specific fuel consumption), CO (carbon monoxide), NOX (nitrogen oxide), and HC (hydrocarbon). These parameters were tested for different load conditions such as 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%. From the results, it shows that SFC is lower for B20 blend compared to that of pure diesel fuel, while B10, B30, B40, and B50 blends have slightly higher values. From the experiment, it is found that emissions of the HC and NOx were reduced and CO emission is slightly higher than the pure diesel. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Biodiesel appears as a replenishable and sustainable energy source and can be used a direct replacement to petro-diesel without any major transformations in ongoing diesel engines. This work concentrates on production of Calophyllum Inophyllum biodiesel (CIB) and preparing 10% blend (CIB10) sample to investigate the effects of varying the injection strategies and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) in common-rail direct injection engine. The experimental results shows that 10% of pilot fuel and 90% main injection strategy (B10@P10-M90) is superior among all others injection strategies with respect to pure diesel. B10@P10-M90 fuel injection strategy produces the maximum efficiency of 35.8% and lowest fuel consumption of 0.25 kg/kWh compared to all the injection strategies. The carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions are also found to be quite low compared to all the other test samples including pure diesel. However B10@P10-M90 results in higher average oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emission which is 18.9% higher in contrast to conventional diesel at full load condition. With the implementation of 10% and 20% EGR with B10@P10-M90, the average NOx emissions decreased by 14.4% and 27.6% respectively compared to B10@P10-M90 without any EGR without significant loss in the performance of the existing diesel engine. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work is the second part of a study on low-load combustion stability for gasoline partially premixed combustion. In part 1, we investigated the sensitivity of the intake air temperature to combustion stability. In part 2, we evaluate the potential of the multiple-injection strategy along with the intake air temperature sensitivity to promote low-load combustion stability using low-octane gasoline fuel. The experiments were carried out in a fully transparent, single-cylinder, compression-ignition engine. The spray/wall interaction, particularly the fuel trapping in the piston crevice zone, was visualized by fuel-tracer planar laser-induced fluorescence for the first time in experiments. The in-cylinder combustion process of natural flame luminosity was captured by a high-speed color camera. By employing a multiple-injection strategy, the minimum intake air temperature can be further reduced from 70 °C (single injection)to 50 °C for target stable combustion. The combustion stability and engine performance were further improved by increasing the fuel injection pressure. For instance, with the triple-injection strategy at a higher fuel-injection pressure of 800 bar, the indicated mean effective pressure was increased by 24% when compared to that of the single-injection strategy. A stronger interaction among fuel spray jets, the piston, and the cylinder wall was observed for multiple injections with higher injection pressure, leading to higher unburned hydrocarbon (UHC)and carbon monoxide (CO)along with a more pronounced pool fire in the squish zone. The double-injection strategy resulted in lower UHC and CO emissions when compared to the triple-injection strategy. Applying a narrow spray angle injector with re-entrant combustion chamber is suggested for optimizing the spray/wall interaction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Application of metal nanoparticles as combustion catalyst in diesel biodiesel fuel blends has grown recently. Efficient utilization of modified nanofluid fuels (MNF) is possible only when engine operating, fuel injection parameters are optimized accordingly. In the present research, experimental and statistical analysis is carried out on a commercial diesel engine (3.5 KW) with the aim to determine the optimal doping rate of nanoparticles and engine operating parameters using response surface methodology (RSM) and desirability function approach (DFA). The modified nanofluid (MNF) fuels used are blend of Acacia Concinna biodiesel (40% by vol.) and diesel (60% by vol.) mixed with titanium dioxide (TiO2) metal nanoparticles in different concentrations. Initially, the prepared fuel blends are characterized by SEM, TEM, blend stability (Uv–Vis spectrophotometery and sedimentation analysis) and various other properties. The optimal value, TiO2 doping rate of 150 mg/liter (MNF150), injection timing of 22.5 °CA btdc and 82.37% engine load is found to be the most suitable combination. Under these condition, brake thermal efficiency (BTE), brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), ignition delay (ID), hydrocarbon (HC), smoke emissions are improved by 3.25%, 18.42%,7%, 38%, 20% respectively with slightly higher NOx emissions in comparison to diesel. This is observed with an overall high desirability value of 0.707. The modeling of engine output responses are (assuming quadratic model order) found to be statistically fit at 95.0% C.I level with residuals to be normally distributed. Further, a close agreement between experimental and model predicted values of responses, prove the adequacy of developed models. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae offer promising and multifaceted solutions to the ongoing issues regarding energy security and climate change. One of the major bottlenecks in utilizing algal biomass is the excessive amount of moisture to be managed after harvest, which translates to costs in the dewatering step. Newer strategies have been developed to be able to convert algal biomass feedstock to biodiesel without the need for extraction and drying, such as in-situ transesterification. This process can be improved by concurrently subjecting the system under subcritical conditions, which could also potentially remove the use of catalysts as well as offer tolerance to free fatty acid content of the feedstock. A definitive screening design of experiment was utilized to provide an acceptable prediction on the effects of key process parameters – temperature, reaction time, and solvent-to-solid ratio to the obtainable fatty acid methyl ester (FAME)yield and process power consumption. The optimum operating condition, which combines the benefits of maximizing the FAME yield and minimizing the process power consumption was found to be at 220 °C, 2 h, and 8 ml methanol per gram of biomass (80 wt% moisture). This produces a FAME yield of 74.6% with respect to the maximum obtainable FAME. Sensitivity analysis discussed the implications regarding the weight of importance between the two responses of interest. The benefits of the proposed process can be observed when compared to its conventional transesterification counterpart in terms of energy savings and reduced environmental impact. Hence, this process offers a feasible alternative to produce biodiesel from microalgae. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Trace amounts of copper decrease significantly the oxidative stability of biodiesel while antioxidants, mostly tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), are commonly introduced to the biofuel to guarantee induction period values within regulatory limits. Hence, a simple method to monitor the most used antioxidant and the most deleterious contaminant in biodiesel can give a fast response on its quality. In this context, this work presents a simple, efficient, low cost and sensitive method for the simultaneous and direct determination of copper and the antioxidant TBHQ in biodiesel. The biodiesel samples were diluted in 90% (v/v) ethanol and 10% (v/v) water containing 0.1 mol L−1 HCl (final concentration) as the supporting electrolyte generating a homogeneous mixture in which Cu(II) and TBHQ were directly detected using the square wave voltammetry (SWV) on a gold working electrode. The presence of biodiesel in the selected electrolyte facilitated the separation of analyte peaks facilitating the treatment of data and quantification. The linear responses for the simultaneous determination were in the range between 5 and 100 μg L−1 and 4.2–81.5 mg L−1 for copper and TBHQ (R &gt; 0.997), respectively. High precision (RSD = 4.0% and 3.9%, n = 20) and limit of detection (LOD) values of 0.31 μg L−1 and 1.0 mg L−1 (0.030 μg g−1 and 0.102 mg g−1 in biodiesel) for Cu(II) and TBHQ, respectively, were obtained. Recovery values between 97% and 104% for both copper and TBHQ were obtained. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biomass conversion into liquid products of interest for the fuel formulations has been draw remarkable attention to reducing the environmental pollution in the world. Biofuels play an important key to mitigating climate changes from the development of sustainable processes. Drop-in biofuels are oxygen-free biofuels composed by liquid hydrocarbons obtained from renewable sources. In the present work, a screening with different catalysts was performed for soybean oil deoxygenation. The niobium phosphate catalyst (NbOPO4) showed a great performance in the production of drop-in fuels in different conditions of reaction. The hydrocarbon yields are in the range of 76–90% (wt%). The redox and acid properties of NbOPO4 led to the simultaneous formation of bio-hydrocarbons, such as linear (38%) and branched alkanes (14%), cycloalkanes (1%), olefins (1%) and aromatics (36%) compounds. NbOPO4 exhibits higher selectivity to bio-jet fuel (58%), followed by green diesel (37%) and biogasoline (21%). This sustainable route to produce bio-hydrocarbons brings a process using N2 gas instead of H2 gas. This is an innovative, sustainable, efficient, safe and low-cost technology with great potential for industry application. © 2019

AB  - Among the various low NOx combustion technologies, MILD combustion combines low pollutant emissions, combustion stability and efficiency, fuel flexibility, and noise reduction through a high preheating of the combustion chamber coupled with a massive exhaust gas recirculation at high turbulence level. In this work, the sustainability of MILD combustion for liquid hydrocarbon-alcohol blends (as possible constituents of surrogate fuels representing the behavior of blends of fossil fuels and biofuels) has been investigated experimentally using a dual-nozzle laboratory-scale burner. Several hydrocarbon-alcohol blends have been investigated to identify the regions (in the furnace temperature vs dilution ratio space) where MILD combustion can be sustained with low NOx and CO emissions. It has been found that the MILD combustion conditions of the various liquid fuel blends investigated differ slightly one to each other and are quite similar to that of the hydrocarbons without any oxygenated species. This means that a MILD combustion burner shows a large flexibility in terms of fuel properties, therefore creating a suitable environment for NOx and CO depression also for fossil fuels-biofuels blends. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The aim of the paper is to present renewable energy market development with particular regard paid to biofuels in the EU. The analysis included data on the share of renewables in Gross Island energy consumption, changes of renewable energy in the years 2004–2016 and the amount of liquid biofuels. The authors of the paper used descriptive and statistical methods to describe the changes in bioenergy development in the European Union (EU). The biggest share of biofuels and renewable waste can be seen in Latvia (31.2%), Finland (26.7%) and Sweden (24.8%). The highest percentage of wind energy in 2015 was found in: Denmark (7.2%), Portugal (4.3%), Ireland (4.0%) and Spain (3.5%). The highest share of solar energy in 2015 was found in Cyprus (3.5%), Spain (2.6%) and Greece (2.2%). The highest contribution of geothermal energy was found in 2015 in Italy (3.5%), Portugal (0.8%) and Slovenia (0,7%). Hydropower was the biggest in 2015 in Sweden (14.2%), Austria (9.6%) and Slovenia (5.0%). The highest coefficients of variation of the share of electricity from renewable energy sources were found in the years 2004–2017 in Malta (140.3%), Cyprus (101.1%) and United Kingdom (71.9%). In addition, the highest coefficients of variation of share of renewable energy sources in heating and cooling in the years 2004–2017 were found in Malta (72.4%), United Kingdom (69.81%) and Hungary (44.91%). Moreover, the highest coefficients of variation of share of renewable energy sources in transport in the years 2004–2017 were found in Finland (113.78%), Malta (115.52%) and Belgium (96.53%). The biggest producers of ethanol and biodiesel in EU were Germany, France and Poland. Cluster analysis data show that Germany and France are of key importance in the production of biodiesel and ethanol. The biodiesel production increased in the years 2003–2017 from 719,32 million liters to 13323 million liters (increase 1852.2%). However, in the years 2014–2017 a stagnation in biofuel production was observed from 13673 million liters to 13323 million liters (−2,56%). The situation on the market and the increasing demand for green energy suggest that the production of ethanol and esters of vegetable oils will increase by 2030, which will contribute to the development of this sector. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The vision of a pathway to a sustainable society is based on the three-pillar conception of sustainability (economic, environmental, and social) that is expected to result in a significant improvement in the reliability, security, and affordability of energy, materials, water, and food. This pathway should include launching a multidisciplinary and least-cost strategy to move from today's carbon-based economy toward a sustainable economy and, at the same time, to provide the needed energy, water, food, and materials for present and future generations. It is imperative that chemical engineers do not relinquish their leadership role in research and development as global energy systems continue to evolve in a historical cycle from primary reliance on wood to coal and oil, to current reliance on natural gas as a transitional fuel in contributing to a pathway to sustainable global energy systems. Although multidisciplinary research and development is needed to move forward on a pathway to sustainability, in this paper, specific areas of research and development are discussed in which chemical engineers should assume a leadership role or become major contributors in this critical initiative. These areas include, but are not limited to: carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration; process intensification; material recycling; water management and desalination; biofuel; natural gas production and conversion; energy storage; and renewable energy, including concentrated solar energy use in chemical, pharmaceutical, and biological processes, and advanced materials for photovoltaics. © 2019

AB  - Background: Black soldier fly (BSF, Hermetia illucens L.) can efficiently degrade organic wastes and transform into a high fat containing insect biomass that could be used as feedstock for biodiesel production. Meanwhile, the molecular regulatory basis of fat accumulation by BSF is still unclear; it is necessary to identify vital genes and regulators that are involved in fat accumulation. Results: This study analyzed the dynamic state of fat content and fatty-acid composition of BSF larvae in eight different stages. The late prepupa stage exhibited the highest crude fat, with lauric acid being the main component. Therefore, to provide insight into this unexplained phenomenon, the molecular regulation of rapid fat accumulation by BSF larvae was investigated. The twelve developmental stages of BSF were selected for transcriptome analysis, including the eight stages used for investigation of fat content and fatty-acid composition. By Illumina sequencing, 218,295,450,000 nt were generated. Through assembly by Trinity, 70,475 unigenes were obtained with an average length of 1064 nt and an N50 of 1749 nt. The differentially expressed unigenes were identified by DESeq, with 9159 of them being up-regulated and 10,101 of them were down-regulated. The several putative genes that are involved in the formation of pyruvate, acetyl-CoA biosynthesis, acetyl-CoA transcription, fatty-acid biosynthesis, and triacylglycerol biosynthesis were identified. The four vital metabolic genes that are associated with fat accumulation were validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The molecular mechanism of fat accumulation in BSF was clarified in this investigation through the construction of a detailed fat accumulation model from our results. Conclusion: The study provides an unprecedented level of insight from transcriptome sequencing to reveal the crude fat accumulation mechanism in developing BSF. The finding holds considerable promise for insectival biodiesel production, and the fat content and fatty-acid composition can be altered by genetic engineering approaches in the future for the insect production industry. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Energy is a determining factor for the global economy blossom. Nowadays, near 80% of the entire energy obtained from fossil fuel is principally applied for transportation area. Exhaustion of fossil fuel sources and greenhouse gases discharge inspire to the search of alternative fuels such as biodiesel. Due to the similar fuel attributes, biodiesel can be regarded as a replacement for diesel. In this study, it is aimed at producing four different biodiesel blends using sunflower oil, corn oil, canola oil, and restaurant waste oil by employing the Transesterification method. Energy and exergy analyses for pure diesel and four extracted biodiesel fuels were conducted operating a direct injection and four-cylinder in-line diesel engine with 3970 c.c. At 50%, and 100% engine load for the speed of 1700 and 2400 rpm. Brake specific fuel consumption, Energy parameters (Input energy, Brake thermal efficiency of the engine, Combustion efficiency, and Energy losses), and exergy parameters (Exergy destruction and exergy efficiency) were assessed. It was found that by increases in brake thermal efficiency, the brake-specific fuel consumption lowers. At 1700 rpm, B20 canola biodiesel blend has the lowest brake-specific fuel consumption and has the best efficiency. At 2400 rpm, B10 canola biodiesel blend presents the lowest fuel consumption and the highest efficiency. In the case of exergy analyses, B10 canola biodiesel shows the highest exergy efficiency in both engine speeds. And the canola biodiesel blends present the lowest exergy destruction in all engine states. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Availability of information on the efficiency of applied conditions to biodiesel synthesis from diverse seed oil can establish optimal biodiesel yield from favourable reaction variables. The effect of reaction parameters; temperature, time and catalyst amount, were varied on biodiesel yield from alcoholysis of Parinari polyandra oil using potassium hydroxide as catalyst. Maximum biodiesel yield of 95.62% was obtained from the experimental results. Analysis of Variance revealed that the reaction variables had significant effects on biodiesel yield. Data analysis predicted an optimal biodiesel yield of 92.75% at reaction conditions of 61.20°C temperature, 60 min, and 1 wt% of catalyst amount. Validation experiments of the optimal conditions gave an average biodiesel yield of 91.72%. The study established optimal conditions of temperature, time, and catalyst amount for biodiesel production from P. polyandra oil. The fuel properties of the biodiesel fell within the standards of the American Society for Testing and Materials D6751. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study evaluates biorefinery bio-oil feedstock costs at the plant gate for a prospective field pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.) to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) supply chain. The biorefinery would supply SAF to the Nashville, Tennessee international airport. Supply chain activities include pennycress production, transporting oilseed to a crushing facility, processing of oilseed into bio-oil, and transporting bio-oil to the biorefinery. The analysis shows profit potential for economic agents in the prospective supply chain. Estimated breakeven cost (profit = 0) of growing, harvesting, and transporting oilseed to a crushing facility is 17.7 ¢ kg−1. A crushing facility can pay up to 23.8 ¢ kg−1 for pennycress oilseed during the first year of production and provide investors 12.5% annual rate of return. Therefore, a profit margin of up to 6.1 ¢ kg−1 is available for the crushing facility to induce prospective pennycress producers to supply oilseed for SAF production. However, the estimated profit margin was sensitive mainly to uncertain oilseed yields, changes in field production costs, and pennycress meal and bio-oil prices. A spatial biorefineries sitting model, the Biofuels Facility Location Analysis Modeling Endeavor, estimated that the least-cost supply chain configuration is to establish three crushing facilities located in Union City, Huntington, and Clarksville, TN, to supply bio-oil to the biorefinery, with the biorefinery sited in an industrial park about 24.14 km from the Nashville international airport aviation fuel storage. Estimated total costs of bio-oil at the biorefinery plant gate are between 83 and 109 ¢ kg−1 if crushing facility oilseed procurement costs are between 17.7 and 23.8 ¢ kg−1 for oilseed. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Algal biofuel has yet to realize its potential as a commercial and sustainable bioenergy source, largely due to the challenge of maximizing and sustaining biomass production with respect to energetic and material inputs in large-scale cultivation. Experimental studies have shown that multispecies algal polycultures can be designed to enhance biomass production, stability, and nutrient recycling compared to monocultures. Yet, it remains unclear whether these impacts of biodiversity make polycultures more sustainable than monocultures. Here, we present results of a comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) for algal biorefineries to compare the sustainability metrics of monocultures and polycultures of six fresh-water algal species. Our results showed that when algae were grown in outdoor experimental ponds, certain bicultures improved the energy return on investment (EROI) and greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) by 20% and 16%, respectively, compared to the best monoculture. Bicultures outperformed monocultures by performing multiple functions simultaneously (e.g., improved stability, nutrient efficiency, biocrude characteristics), which outweighed the higher productivity attainable by a monoculture. Our results demonstrate that algal polycultures with optimized multifunctionality lead to enhanced life cycle metrics, highlighting the significant potential of ecological engineering for enabling future environmentally sustainable algal biorefineries. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Recent movements for the decarbonization of the electricity sector have become a priority for many countries around the world and will inevitably lead to the sharp decline of fossil-fuel-based energy. Energy from fossil fuels is to be replaced by renewable energy sources (RES), although the transition will neither be cheap nor smooth. One sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to fossil fuels and which will take a considerable share in the increasing supply of renewable energy resources is biofuels. There are various types of biofuels used in practice; however, biodiesels represent one of the most popular and widespread ones. This paper focuses as a case study on the byproducts of Jatropha curcas, a crop and a plant that is already used for biofuel production and which is subsequently employed in electricity generation in Jatropha curcas producing regions. This paper identifies the limitations and prospects of Jatropha curcas utilization. Also, Jatropha curcas is compared to other materials suitable for biomass generation. An economic analysis for a 2 MW biofuel powerplant was conducted incorporating various market-related risks. The study shows that at current prices, net profitability can be achieved using Jatropha curcas byproducts for producing electricity. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The diminishing reserves of fossil fuel, indecision in its availability and global warming issues has interested many researchers to look for the renewable source of fuel. The main source of renewable liquid fuel was oils of the seed crops. One of the oilseed crops that had been studied is Pongamia pinnata L. (further is called P. pinnata). Oil content and fatty acid composition are important attribute desirable in seed oil. Monounsaturated fatty acids are the best components for biodiesel (i.e. oxygenate fuel) when considering the low temperature fluidity and oxidative stability. However, biodiesel derived from vegetable oils always consists of significant amounts of polyunsaturated and saturated fatty acids alkyl esters, which hampers its practical applications. Therefore, in order to increase added value of vegetable oils, the oxygenate fuels (e.g. biodiesel) should be modified to biohydrocarbon fuel (e.g. green diesel) which has similar properties to diesel fuel from fossil. In addition, straight-chain saturated hydrocarbon molecules (n-paraffin) should be as well as modified to be branched hydrocarbons to lowering the freezing point and low temperature fluidity of the renewable fuel.Therefore, the renewable fuel applications become more widely. The objective of this work to evaluate the biohydrocarbon (renewable fuel) profile that resulting of decarboxylation of Mg-Zn basic soap based on P. pinnata seed oil. It was found that oil content in P. pinnata seeds originate of Kupang was 36.01 weight%. The monoun saturated compounds contained in the oil approximately 30%. Decarboxylation of Mg-Zn basic soap resulting high biohydrocarbon with main carbon chain length were 15 (C15). © 2019, EM International. All rights reserved.

AB  - To enhance the mass transfer efficiency of bio-oil inside the zeolite based catalyst and improve the catalytic selectivity of jet biofuel product, conventional Y zeolite was modified into hierarchical mesoporous Y (meso-Y) zeolite by desilication and loaded with Ni to catalyze the conversion of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) into jet biofuel. Mesopores in the range of 2 to 10 nm were effectively generated by desilication with NaOH and a certain degree of crystal structure expansion was caused accordingly. When Ni was loaded on meso-Y zeolite treated with 0.4 mol/L NaOH for 1 h, BET surface area and specific pore volume were increased to 554.9 m2/g and 0.340 cm3/g, respectively. A maximum of jet biofuel product selectivity (65.8%) was hence obtained. Iso-alkanes and arenes took up 19.1% and 12.8% within jet biofuel product, guaranteeing the fuel characteristics. As by-products of both hydrodeoxygenation and hydrocracking, the selectivity of CH4 in the gas phase product was up to 25.2%, and the CO2 is stable at about 12%. Although the overall selectivity of jet biofuel product varied greatly with NaOH treatment duration, the proportion of each component remained stable. Desilication only modified the physical structure of meso-Y zeolite to enhance the mass transfer of reactants and products. Its chemical properties were preserved to maintain the catalytic activity. © All Right Reserved.

AB  - Biodiesel emerges as an alternative biofuel for fossil ones because it is less polluting and can be produced from renewable sources. However, biofuels are generally more susceptible to auto-oxidation than fossil ones. Some fundamental characteristics in biofuel must be controlled in order to permit the correct operation of engines, so that the National Agency for Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP) establishes specific resolutions about that. In most cases, the biofuel is poorly resistant to auto-oxidation, being required the addition of extrinsic antioxidant agents. In this work, it was demonstrated the curcumin is a natural product with excellent antioxidant behavior to be added to commercial biodiesel samples. The physical-chemical characteristics, induction period measured using Rancimat method EN14112 and acid number by ASTM D 664 method were investigated in present work for two commercial biodiesel samples prepared with different raw materials (soybean oil or soybean oil with beef tallow). The presence of beef tallow in one of the samples was positive for this biofuel quality in all of the aspects analyzed. Curcumin proved to be an efficient antioxidant for both biodiesel samples, increasing the induction period and reducing the acid number, guaranteeing good oxidative stability for commercial biodiesels studied. © 2019, Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul, Departamento de Quimica.

AB  - Used kitchen oil represents a feasible and renewable biomass to produce green biofuels such as biodiesel. Biodiesel production generates large amounts of by-products such as the crude glycerol fraction, which can be further used biotechnologically as a valuable nutrient for many microorganisms. In this study, we transesterified used kitchen oil with methanol and sodium hydroxide in order to obtain biodiesel and crude glycerol fractions. The crude glycerol fraction consisting of 30% glycerol was integrated into a bioreactor cultivation process as a nutrient source for the growth of Candida zeylanoides ATCC 20367. Cell viability and biomass production were similar to those obtained with batch cultivations on pure glycerol or glucose as the main nutrient substrates. However, the biosynthesis of organic acids (e.g., citric and succinic) was significantly different compared to pure glycerol and glucose used as main carbon sources. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - In this study, the effect of using a blended biodiesel fuel containing 10% rapeseed methyl ester (RME) on the composition and quantity of the chemicals emitted by a modern diesel engine was investigated. The diesel engine that was utilized fulfilled Japan’s Post New Long Term emission standards and was equipped with an after-treatment system comprising a diesel oxidation catalyst and a catalyzed diesel particulate filter (c-DPF). Using the Japanese JE05 transient cycle as the testing cycle, the exhaust gas was sampled for three different states: when the after-treatment system was not deployed, termed “engine-out” (due to the sampling location); when the after-treatment system was deployed, termed “tailpipe-out” (likewise due the sampling location); and when the after-treatment system was deployed and the c-DPF was regenerating, termed “regen”. Evidence from this study indicated that the use of 10% RME biodiesel had no significant impact on the emissions of CO, CO2, the total hydrocarbons, and NOx, which are regulated, regardless of the sampling state. However, the emissions of elemental carbon, organic carbon, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are unregulated, showed some effects. During engine-out and tailpipe-out, emissions of the elemental carbon species EC2 were slightly lower when using the biodiesel blend than the petroleum diesel (D) fuel; however, an increase in the organic carbon species OC1 and OC2 and in some PAHs was observed during regen because of the sizable consumption of the biodiesel blend compared to D fuel. These results confirm that 10% RME biodiesel is a promising alternative to fossil fuels for diesel engines, but it is important to grasp the behavior of individual components and carefully investigate the effects of increased mixing ratios. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.

AB  - Microalgae was recognized as the sustainable energy feedstock for producing biofuels. Now bio-diesel produced from algal biomass is getting ready to address the energy crisis that the world would face tomorrow. This paper deals with the utilization of microalgae biodiesel at 30% blend, to investigate the influence of operating parameter such as injection pressure on the characteristics of a compression ignition engine. Microalgae crude oil was derived from chlorella vulgaries and it was converted into microalgae methyl ester (MME) using transesterification process. The desired test fuel was prepared by mixing of 30% MME with 70% pure diesel and designated as B30. The experiment was conducted on single cylinder four stroke diesel engine powered with B30 at various fuel injection pressures in the range of 180 bar, 200 bar and 220 bar. The experimental results showed that, no significant impact of modified injection pressures on BSFC, whereas BTE was increased maximum by 14.09% at 200 bar. The exhaust emissions such as CO, CO2, UHC and smoke opacity were improved mostly at 200 bar injection pressure, but NOX emission was increased, and increment in cylinder peak pressure was discovered only at 200 bar. © BEIESP.

AB  - An increase of needs for replacement of fossil fuels, and for mitigation of Carbon Dioxide emissions generated from fossil fuels inspires the search for new fuels based on renewable biological resources. It would be convenient if the biological component of the fuel required as little as possible conversion operations in the production. The obvious response is an attempt to use unconverted, neat plant oils as a fuel for Diesel engines. The present paper is devoted to the experimental studies of the combustion process of neat rapeseed oil, and its mixtures with gasoline and ethanol as additional components of the mixtures. The investigation of combustion was carried out in a fixed volume combustion chamber equipped with a Common Rail injection system. It is shown that the instant of ignition, as well as time-dependence of heat emanation, are strongly dependent upon mixture composition. The results enable the design of mixture compositions that could serve as commercial fuel for Diesel engines. Such fuels are expected to fulfill the requirements for the sustainability of road transport. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - This article presents our research results on the physical-chemical and direct injection diesel engine performance parameters when fueled by pure diesel fuel and retail hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO). This fuel is called NexBTL by NESTE, and this renewable fuel blends with a diesel fuel known as Pro Diesel. A wide range of pure diesel fuel and NexBTL100 blends have been tested and analyzed: pure diesel fuel, pure NexBTL, NexBTL10, NexBTL20, NexBTL30, NexBTL40, NexBTL50, NexBTL70 and NexBTL85. The energy, pollution and in-cylinder parameters were analyzed under medium engine speed (n = 2000 and n = 2500 rpm) and brake torque load regimes (30-120 Nm). AVL BOOST software was used to analyze the heat release characteristics. The analysis of brake specific fuel consumption showed controversial results due to the lower density of NexBTL. The mass fuel consumption decreased by up to 4%, and the volumetric consumption increased by up to approximately 6%. At the same time, the brake thermal efficiency mainly increased by approximately 0.5-1.4%. CO, CO2, NOx, HC and SM were analyzed, and the change in CO was negligible when increasing NexBTL in the fuel blend. Higher SM reduction was achieved while increasing the percentage of NexBTL in the blends. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - In this paper, we have proposed a reaction–diffusion system of partial differential equations which model the plankton-nutrient interaction mediated by a toxin-determined functional response. It has been established that microalgae, a clean and green source of energy, can be potentially used for carbon capture and sequestration. The common biofuels (bio-diesel and ethanol) are efficiently extracted from microalgae of different shapes and sizes. A spatio-temporal model has been presented to guide exploration and harvesting of microalgae (e.g., dinoflagellates, cilliates, chlorella, etc.). The spatial distribution of the phytoplankton (microalgae) is determined by growth pattern of the biotic subsystem (phytoplankton and zooplankton); e.g., whether it is oscillatory or aperiodic. The model incorporates a toxin-determined functional response of the zooplankton, which can be parametrized for specific phytoplankton–zooplankton combinations in different aquatic bodies such as ponds, seas, and oceans. The present model does not take into account higher zooplankton's role in maintaining the core subsystem. The temporal model is analytically investigated in terms of the existence criteria and stability analysis (both linear and nonlinear) of the possible equilibria and the spatio-temporal model is studied in terms of global stability, Turing instability and existence of Hopf-bifurcation which help us to explore the dynamical behavior of the spatial model system. Numerical simulations are carried out to support the obtained theoretical results. Simulation experiments and computed densities thereof (equal densities are codes by same color) suggest that the spatial distribution of microalgae is complex; e.g., spatial density of microalgae varies chaotically for certain parameter sets. Harvesting schedule can be designed based on information thus derived. It should be implemented carefully in case the spatial density distribution is chaotic. The sustainability of the marine system for future use has been the prime concern. Parameters of harvesting strategy (time, intensity and technology) are determined in such a way that exploitation causes minimal damage to the environment and the yield of the harvest is maximal. Future studies would consider larger carnivorous fishes (e.g., Squids, Dolphins) on system's dynamics. The effect of oceanic noise and colloidal swarming of zooplankton in the presence of bacteria will also be incorporated. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this work, the development and usability of kapok oil in diesel engine was intended. With this purpose, the piston crowns are coated with mullite–lanthanum (ML) ceramic composite at varying compositions in order to reduce the heat rejection during combustion process. The kapok oil is blended with diesel fuel consisting of (20% kapok oil–80% diesel) volumetrically named B fuel. The B and diesel (D) fuels are taken for the engine performance test with different coated piston (ML1, ML2, and ML3) and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR—10%, 20%, and 30%), compression ratio (CR—16, 17, and 18) and engine load (50%, 75%, and 100%). Also, the engine performance study on brake thermal efficiency (BTE), brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC), hydrocarbons (HCs), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), smoke opacity, and numerical study using ANSYS software is carried out. When operated with ML2-coated pistons with B fuel, maximum BTE value of 29.2%, minimum BSFC value of 0.224 kg/kW-h, CO emission of 0.2%, and smoke opacity of 39 ppm were observed. The results showed that ML2-coated piston considerably improved the performance of the test engines when compared with ML1 and ML3 coatings. Except for NOx emission, all other pollutant emission values were reduced. The numerical analysis using ANSYS software for ML2-coated pistons showed better retention of in-cylinder chamber temperature. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Different microalgae species produce varying quantity and quality of the lipids. Fatty acid methyl ester composition, which comprises both saturated and unsaturated contents, critically affects biodiesel properties. Current study compares six locally isolated microalgae strains belonging to three classes (Trebouxiophyceae, Chlorophyceae, and Cyanophyceae) on the basis of lipid content and biodiesel properties. All the six species are grown in similar condition up to the late stationary phase, and their lipid content and fatty acid methyl ester composition are measured experimentally. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) tool has ranked Calothrix species (class Cyanophyceae) on the top, owing to better cetane number, density and oxidation stability; whereas Chlorococcum species (class Chlorophyceae) is ranked second because of its higher lipid content, better cold flow property, and low viscosity. Property analysis of these two species is extended in the enlarge temperature range for five properties, vapor pressure, latent heat of vaporization, liquid density, liquid viscosity and vapor diffusivity, which are important in spray and combustion modeling. It is found through detailed property estimation that Chlorococcum sp. is a more suitable species in comparison with Calothrix sp. as it is having better properties and its lipid content is much higher than that of Calothrix sp. Although the properties of microalgae biodiesel are poorer in comparison with conventional diesel fuel, a greater number of such studies will help in understanding the requisite changes as required for microalgae biodiesel–based engine and their properties as compared with conventional diesel. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In this study, waste clay oil was used as raw material to produce high quality biofuel via catalytic pyrolysis. The thermal decomposition and pyrolysis of clay oil were studied; whereas the effects of pyrolysis temperature, carrier gas flow rate, catalytic mode and catalyst to clay oil ratio on bio-oil compositions were investigated systematically. In addition, two kinds of catalyst (MCM-41 and CaO) were also used to catalyze pyrolysis of clay oil and their catalytic effects were also compared. The optimal conditions for producing high quality biofuel were under ex situ catalytic mode, carrier gas rate of 0.1 N L/min, pyrolysis temperature of 550 °C and the catalyst ratio of 1/5. Compared to MCM-41, CaO promoted the decarboxylation of waste clay oil and improved the quality of bio-oil effectively. The acid value of CaO catalytic bio-oil was much lower than that of non-catalytic bio-oil as well as that the calorific value is much higher than that of non-catalytic bio-oil and bio-diesel. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate simultaneously the effect of produced ethanolic biodiesel from several feedstocks (soybean, crambe, macaw, sunflower, and waste cooking oil) and engine operational conditions (low and high engine speed) during combustion of biodiesel/diesel blends on the N2O, NOx, NO, CO2, and CO emission levels in the atmosphere. The biodiesel samples were prepared in one and/or two reaction steps, according to the acid index of each raw material, by esterification using H2SO4 and/or chemical transesterification using sodium ethoxide, both, through ethanolic route. The quality of the produced biodiesels was confirmed by ASTM/EN specifications. Then, biodiesel/diesel blends were prepared according to the following proportions: 10% (B10), 15% (B15), 25% (B25), and 50% (B50). In general way, all raw materials under combustion at low and high engine speed contributed to the formation of NOx and this effect was more drastically increased as the biodiesel concentration in the blends increases. N2O presented a similar behavior except for blends containing crambe and macaw biodiesel whose emissions were slightly reduced as a function of biodiesel content in these blends. Then, Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to discriminate the effect of engine operating conditions, biodiesel kind, and biodiesel content in the blends during their combustion on the exhaust emissions. The attained results point to crambe and macaw as more environmentally sustainable feedstocks for biodiesel production because they generate less greenhouse gas emissions. These results are particularly attractive considering that, both, crambe and macaw are non-edible feedstocks with great potential for biodiesel production. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The gradual reduction of subsidies for electricity production from biogas and the raising interest of bio-methane as an integration to natural gas market force the biogas plant owners to choose alternative solutions for biogas exploitation. In this study, two solutions for biomethane distribution have been compared: biomethane liquefaction and grid injection. The analysis was carried out as a function of gas connection cost, electric tariff, selling price and type of expander adopted in the liquefaction cycle (radial turbines or screw expanders). A nitrogen Joule-Brayton reverse cycle was considered for liquefaction. A detailed model of the cycle was developed in Aspen Hysys and optimized to minimize the energy specific consumption. Results show that expander efficiency has a key role in the liquefaction scenario. Screw expanders lead to a specific consumption 1.45 times higher than radial turbines but reduce capital costs by a factor of 1.39. Biomethane grid injection is the preferable solution in terms of investment risk if the connection cost is below 500 k$, independently on the electricity price. As far as it concerns the profit, liquefaction with radial turbines is preferable up to electricity price of 0.23 $/kWh. A sensitivity analysis on product selling prices shows that biomethane grid injection is always the most profitable solution when connection costs are low. For higher connections cost, liquefaction with radial turbines is the best solution for minimizing the investment risk and maximizing the profit for most of the combination of selling prices. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Reduction of environmental pollution and fossil fuel dependence are two worldwide concerned problems. Many research projects have addressed many solutions for these issues, in which, the trend of using bio-fuel has been widely studied and applied. Ethanol, a kind of biofuel has been used on motorcycle engines, which use carburetor system, to replace conventional gasoline. Ethanol is characterized by a higher heat of vaporization value than gasoline, thus the reduction of the intake manifold temperature which effects engine performance especially at cold starting and idling conditions. In this study, a certain amount of exhaust gas was recirculated to heat the intake manifold, thereby increasing intake mixture temperature, to improve the combustion process of the engine, results in improvement of engine performances. In experiment, an exhaust gas heating transfer system was designed to recirculate a partial mass of exhaust gas to transfer heat energy to the intake manifold of the test motorcycle fueled with ethanol. The experimental results show that, with the exhaust gas heating transfer system, the specific fuel consumption of the test engine improve remarkably and some gaseous emissions tend to be reduced; in addition, hot starting ability of the test engine with the heating transfer system improves significantly compared to the case of without the system. © 2019 International Energy Initiative

AB  - Nanostructure of soot particles from a small-bore compression-ignition engine was investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Four test fuels namely conventional diesel, waste cooking oil (WCO) biodiesel, Jatropha biodiesel, and Karanja biodiesel were studied. Lacey carbon TEM grids were utilized to capture soot particles from engine exhaust gas. An in-house image processing algorithm was developed to measure primary particle diameter, fringe length, fringe tortuosity, and fringe spacing. The HRTEM image revealed the presence of thicker absorbed hydrocarbon layers surrounding biodiesel soot primary particles than those of diesel soot. The primary particle size of WCO biodiesel was smaller than diesel, on the other hand, Jatropha biodiesel and Karanja biodiesel showed slightly larger particles. In terms of nano-structure analysis, WCO biodiesel and Jatropha biodiesel particles exhibited shorter fringe length than diesel, while the Karanja biodiesel particles showed the longest fringe length of 0.91 nm. Fringe tortuosity of biodiesels was smaller than diesel because of relatively lower portion of core area, where highly curved fringes existed. The soot particles from biodiesels exhibited larger fringe spacing than diesel, especially the Karanja biodiesel showed the longest fringe spacing of 0.67 nm compared to 0.55 nm in case of diesel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The oleaginous yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides AS 2.1389 is viewed as desirable industrial microorganisms that can accumulate a high content of lipids for biodiesel production. In this study, we attempted to improve lipid accumulation in the yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides by UV irradiation mutagenesis and selection based on lithium chloride tolerance or ethanol–H2O2 tolerance. The biomass concentration, lipid yield and glucose consumption of mutant R. toruloides were determined. The transcription levels of lipid accumulation-related genes in the wild-type and mutant strains were also determined. The lithium chloride-tolerant strain R-ZL2 and the ethanol–H2O2-resistant strain R-ZY13 were generated by UV mutagenesis. The two mutant strains showed greater lipid productivity and lipid yield compared to the wild type. Transcriptional analysis revealed that IDP1, GPD1 and GND were expressed at significantly higher levels in the two high-lipid-producing mutants. In conclusion, lipid productivity and lipid yield in R. toruloides were successfully improved via UV mutagenesis and selection. We also identified some lipid accumulation-related genes for improving lipid productivity through genetic engineering. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - The saturated hydrocarbon bisabolane is a diesel fuel substitute that can be derived from sesquiterpene precursors bisabolene or curcumene. These sesquiterpenes are generated from farnesyl diphosphate in reactions catalyzed by eponymous terpenoid cyclases, but they can also be generated by engineered terpenoid cyclases in which cyclization cascades have been reprogrammed by mutagenesis. Here, we describe the X-ray crystal structure determination of F95Q epi-isozizaene synthase (EIZS), in which the new activity of curcumene biosynthesis has been introduced and the native activity of epi-isozizaene biosynthesis has been suppressed. F95Q EIZS generates β- and γ-curcumene regioisomers with greater than 50% yield. Structural analysis of the closed active site conformation, stabilized by the binding of 3 Mg2+ ions, inorganic pyrophosphate, and the benzyltriethylammonium cation, reveals a product-like active site contour that serves as the cyclization template. Remolding the active site contour to resemble curcumene instead of epi-isozizaene is the principal determinant of the reprogrammed cyclization cascade. Intriguingly, an ordered water molecule comprises part of the active site contour. This water molecule may also serve as a final proton acceptor, along with inorganic pyrophosphate, in the generation of curcumene regioisomers; it may also contribute to the formation of sesquiterpene alcohols identified as minor side products. Thus, the substitution of polar side chains for nonpolar side chains in terpenoid cyclase active sites can result in the stabilization of bound water molecules that, in turn, can serve template functions in isoprenoid cyclization reactions. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Coproducts from bioenergy processing have potential as alternative products in the market, thereby reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Thus far, the environmental benefits from coproduct use have been overlooked in most studies because of the lack of knowledge on their effective use and the limited commercialization. The objective of this study is to investigate the energy and GHG emissions savings by using biofuel coproducts. The effects of coproduct use on the overall life cycle GHG emissions performance of biofuels were evaluated. Dry distiller grains in the wheat to ethanol pathway, and crude glycerine and canola meal from biodiesel, are assumed to replace animal feed, fossil fuel, fertilizer, synthetic glycerine. A system expansion approach was implemented to estimate GHG emissions savings. The results show that the overall life cycle GHG emissions from the wheat to ethanol pathway can be reduced by 2–34% when dry distiller grains displace fertilizer, fossil fuel, or animal feed. In the canola to biodiesel pathway, GHG emissions can be reduced by 5–26% and 8–41% when canola meal replaces animal feed and crude glycerine replaces synthetic glycerine. The study highlights the potential role of the coproducts from biofuel production in additional GHG emissions reduction over the life cycle. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Plants are an attractive sourceof renewable carbon for conversion to biofuels and bio-based chemicals. Conversion strategies often use a fraction of the biomass, focusing on sugars from cellulose and hemicellulose. Strategies that use plant components, such as aromatics and amino acids, may improve the efficiency of biomass conversion. Pseudomonas putida is a promising host for its ability to metabolize a wide variety of organic compounds. P. putida was engineered to produce methyl ketones, which are promising diesel blendstocks and potential platform chemicals, from glucose and lignin-related aromatics. Unexpectedly, P. putida methyl ketone production using Arabidopsis thaliana hydrolysates was enhanced 2–5-fold compared with sugar controls derived from engineered plants that overproduce lignin-related aromatics. This enhancement was more pronounced (~seven-fold increase) with hydrolysates from nonengineered switchgrass. Proteomic analysis of the methyl ketone-producing P. putida suggested that plant-derived amino acids may be the source of this enhancement. Mass spectrometry-based measurements of plant-derived amino acids demonstrated a high correlation between methyl ketone production and amino acid concentration in plant hydrolysates. Amendment of glucose-containing minimal media with a defined mixture of amino acids similar to those found in the hydrolysates studied led to a nine-fold increase in methyl ketone titer (1.1 g/L). © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - In this study, hydrocracking of coconut oil over Ni-Fe/HZSM-5 catalyst was carried out in a batch reactor under different reaction temperature. Coconut oil is proposed as one of the potential feedstock for biofuel production. The Ni-Fe/HZSM-5 catalyst was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method. The characterization of Ni-Fe/HZSM-5 catalyst by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy Dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDAX), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET). The chemical composition of biofuel was analyzed by Gas-Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). The results from the GC-MS analysis showed that the hydrocracking reaction over 10 % (Ni-Fe)/HZSM-5 catalyst at temperature of 375 oC obtained the highest hydrocarbon content (contained 49.4% n-paraffin, 26.93 % isoparaffin, 3.58 % olefin) and the highest yield of bio-gasoil 38.6 % in the biofuel liquid hydrocarbon. Pentadecane (n-C15) and heptadecane (n-C17) were the most abundant hydrocarbon compounds in biofuel liquid hydrocarbon. Decarboxylation and/or decarbonylation was the dominant reaction pathways in this process. Based on the result, the reaction temperature had a significant effect on the distribution of biofuel composition and yield of biofuel from coconut oil. Copyright © 2019 BCREC Group.

AB  - Biofuels can be produced through a conventional catalytic cracking system and/or a hybrid catalytic-plasma cracking system. This paper was focused on studying effect of Na+ ion exchange to HY-Zeolite catalyst on catalyst performance to convert palm oil into biofuels over a conventional continuous fixed bed catalytic cracking reactor and comparing the catalytic cracking performance when carried out in a continuous hybrid catalytic-plasma reactor. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Bruneuer-Emmet-Teller (BET) surface area methods. The biofuels product were analyzed using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) to determine the hydrocarbons composition of biofuels product. From the results, ion exchange process of Na+ into HY-Zeolite catalyst decreases the catalyst activity due to decreasing the number of active sites caused by blocking of Na+ ion. The selectivity to gasoline ranges achieved 34.25% with 99.11% total conversion when using HY catalyst over conventional continuous fixed bed reactor system. Unfortunately, the selectivity to gasoline ranges decreased to 13.96% and the total conversion decrease slightly to 98.06% when using NaY-Zeolite catalyst. As comparison when the cracking reaction was carried out in a hybrid catalytic-plasma reactor using a spent residual catalytic cracking (RCC) catalyst, the high energetics electron from plasma can improve the reactor performance, where the conversion and yield were increased and the selectivity to lower ranges of hydrocarbons was increased. However, the last results were potential to be intensively studied with respect to relation between reactor temperature and plasma-assisted catalytic reactor parameters. Copyright © 2019 BCREC Group.

AB  - This investigation explored engine performance, combustion and exhaust emissions with a new series of fuels for compression ignition engine. Three blends were formulated using diesel, tea tree oil and diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DGM). Low grade tea tree oil is considered as waste, which was used as fuel in this investigation. DGM was blended with tea tree oil and diesel as an additive for its high oxygen content and cetane number. Diesel was chosen for comparison purposes. The three blends examined in this study were, 70-30-0, 70-20-10 and 70-10-20 in ratios of diesel-tea tree oil-DGM. A six-cylinder, four-stroke, turbocharged diesel engine was used in this experiment. Four different loads of 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% and 1500 revolutions per minute (rpm) were selected for the experiments. Engine performance parameters like efficiency, power, mean effective pressure and specific fuel consumption were considered. In-cylinder pressure, the rate of heat release, peak and boost pressure were considered for combustion parameters. Carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM) and particulate number (PN) were considered for emission parameters. A maximum of 70% PM, 54% PN and 33% CO reductions were observed with three blends. However, 16% higher NOx emissions were observed with the blends. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, Japanese Industrial Standard diesel no 2 and waste cooking oil biodiesel fuels are compared in terms of environmental pollution cost analysis. The experiments of the diesel and biodiesel fueled diesel engine are done at 100 Nm, 200 Nm and full load (294 Nm), while engine speed is constant at 1800 rpm. The method used in this study consists of a combination of economic and environmental parameters. According to the analyses, the total environmental pollution cost of the biodiesel is higher than the diesel fuel. On the other hand, the total cost of the CO2 emissions of the diesel fuel is generally found to be higher than biodiesel fuel in terms of the life cycle based environmental pollution cost. The specific environmental pollution cost is found as minimum at full load to be 2.217 US cent/kWh for the diesel fuel and 2.449 US cent/kWh for the biodiesel fuel at full load. On the other hand, the life cycle based specific environmental pollution cost is determined as minimum at full load to be 5.050 US cent/kWh for the diesel fuel and 5.309 US cent/kWh for the biodiesel fuel. The biodiesel fuel has higher values than diesel fuel in terms of the specific environmental pollution cost rates. The maximum total carbon dioxide emission rate is found as 0.2405 × 10−3 kg/kJ for the biodiesel fuel at 100 Nm engine torque and the minimum one is obtained as 0.1884 × 10−3 kg/kJ for the diesel fuel at full load. When the payback periods of the fuels are examined, biodiesel has longer period than diesel. The environmental payback period and life cycle based environmental payback period are also compared for fuels. In this context, the biodiesel has longer environmental payback periods rates than diesel. Consequently, the biodiesel fueled engine has higher environmental pollution cost rates than the diesel fueled engine, while the total carbon dioxide parameter of the diesel fuel is close to the biodiesel fuel's rate. Also, all of the other environmental parameters of diesel fuel is generally better than biodiesel. Consequently, the diesel fuel is generally better option than the biodiesel considering environmental aspects. For better environmental management, the diesel fuel utilization in the diesel engine is slightly better option than biodiesel fuel in terms of environmental pollution cost analysis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We demonstrated recently that NO concentration measurements are feasible even in the core of largely non-sooting diesel-like jets by combined laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and spontaneous Raman scattering (SRS). However, the question arises whether previous findings hold also for other diesel-like jets. The current study focuses on fuel effects. In the previous NO measurements, n-heptane was used. It is replaced by pure di-n-butylether (DNBE) and a tailor-made blend of 50% DNBE and 50% n-octanol. These fuels are promising biofuel candidates and lead to an interesting variation of mixing during combustion (MDC). The determination of NO concentrations turns out to be generally feasible with the blend on the jet centerline in the quasi-steady phase of the injection event. The corresponding uncertainty is about ± 28 %. By contrast, some of the NO-LIF measurements in sooting DNBE jets are discarded, primarily due to increased light attenuation. For the remaining NO concentrations with DNBE the corresponding uncertainty is about ± 40 %. For the blend, results indicate that NO formation is very similar to the one in the n-heptane jets. Thus, the net effect of changed volatility and oxygenation is seemingly weak. By contrast, quasi-steady centerline NO concentrations are apparently significantly affected by MDC for pure DNBE. Relatively high NO concentrations are observed in this case, although products of highly fuel-rich fluid parcels are also present there. This study indicates the importance of MDC in such jets. © 2019 The Combustion Institute

AB  - This paper aims to produce a quantitative approach on the overall measures and on public support framework for biomass for energy, based on the EU countries reports under RED and existing literature. The way in which the support for biomass is implemented in the EU energy sector is not similar across EU countries. Feed-in tariffs and feed-in-premiums are still the dominant support schemes for the deployment of bioelectricity, whereas subsidies remain the main support for bioheat. Furthermore, a vast number of EU countries apply mandatory blending quotas for biofuels for transport. The paper shows that biomass for energy has a key role within the EU policy support for RES, in which targets are the main drivers, together with overarching biomass guidelines to anticipate any environmental constraints. Stable support showed the highest effectiveness in the past and remains the key factor for biomass deployment beyond 2020. The renewed targets need to be accompanied by long-term support measures and a commonly shared policy vision. A further harmonization of public bioenergy support towards a single EU cleaner energy market is recommended. This implies four policy actions for all EU countries: in-depth efficiency review, integration with RED-2, compatible sustainability guidelines and local impact assessments. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Deoxygenation of methyl laurate was carried out over potassium FAU zeolites. The influence of the silicon/aluminum molar ratio was studied using K-USY (3.2), KNaY (2.6) and KNaX (1.1). Decreasing the Si/Al ratio increases the basicity of the zeolite, which improved the deoxygenation capacity by decarboxylation/decarbonylation of the methyl laurate. The use of methanol as solvent it is necessary to avoid the transesterification or the hydrolysis of the methyl ester, as well as to produce hydrogen in situ increasing the formation of dodecane. Potassium X zeolite (K-KNaX) showed a steady catalytic activity with the time on stream over 40% with yield to bio-hydrocarbons C10 to C12 of 30% and reaching selectivity of 70%. The biofuel produced reduced the viscosity 25% and improved the heat value 2500 kJ/kg respect to the initial methyl laurate. Therefore, it is possible to upgrade of the biodiesel by thermocatalytic processes using potassium X zeolites. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Third generation biofuels, also known as microalgal biofuels, are promising alternatives to fossil fuels. One attractive option is microalgal biodiesel as a replacement for diesel fuel. Chlamydomonas sp. Tai-03 was previously optimized for maximal lipid production for biodiesel generation, achieving biomass growth and productivity of 3.48 ± 0.04 g/L and 0.43 ± 0.01 g/L/d, with lipid content and productivity of 28.6 ± 1.41% and 124.1 ± 7.57 mg/L/d. In this study, further optimization using 5% CO2 concentration and semi-batch operation with 25% medium replacement ratio, enhanced the biomass growth and productivity to 4.15 ± 0.12 g/L and 1.23 ± 0.02 g/L/d, with lipid content and productivity of 19.4 ± 2.0% and 239.6 ± 24.8 mg/L/d. The major fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were palmitic acid (C16:0), oleic acid (C18:1), and linoleic acid (C18:2). These short-chain FAMEs combined with high growth make Chlamydomonas sp. Tai-03 a suitable candidate for biodiesel synthesis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Continuous hydrothermal liquefaction and further upgrading of the algal biocrude are of great importance for algae biofuel process scale-up and improvement of fuel properties. In this study, two strains of microalgae were used for processing in a continuous stirred tank reactor at 350 °C and 24 MPa for 15 min residence time. An average of 36.2 wt% and 31.5 wt% biocrude yields were achieved for Chlorella vulgaris and Nannochloropsis gaditana, respectively. The obtained biocrude was further upgraded by hydrotreating using commercial NiMo/Al2O3 and NiW/Al2O3 catalysts at two temperatures (250 °C and 400 °C) in a batch autoclave reactor for 4 h. Products distribution, analysis by elemental content, gas chromatography (GC), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR) on upgrading products indicate that upgrading by both catalysts lead to improved physicochemical fuel properties, during 250 °C upgrading step, decarbonylation, decarboxylation and repolymerization are the dominant reactions while hydrodeoxygenation and cracking reaction are more promoted at 400 °C. The gasoline, kerosene and diesel oil components in the algal biocrude were increased from 18 wt% to &gt;30 wt% after catalytic upgrading. © 2019

AB  - An aqueous enzymatic-ultrasonication extraction (AEUE) technique involving sequential treatment with enzyme mixtures (neutral protease/cellulase/pectinase) followed by ultrasonication was proposed for the extraction of oil from Sapindus mukorossi seed kernels. Statistical optimization was successfully applied to determine the optimal AEUE conditions. Three parameters, including enzyme amount, ultrasonic time and power, were screened from eight parameters using the Plackett–Burman design and further optimized by the Box–Behnken design for the attainment of a high yield of S. mukorossi seed kernels oil. The optimal AEUE conditions with a yield of 82.67% ± 2.21%, relative to the Soxhlet method, were obtained as follows: incubation time of 8 h, amount of 4%, pH of 7, incubation temperature of 60 °C, shaking speed of 600 rpm, water solid ratio of 16 mL/g, ultrasonic time of 56 min, and ultrasonic power of 240 W. The S. mukorossi seed kernels oil acquired using AEUE exhibited a lower acid value and a higher iodine value than that acquired by the Soxhlet method. Meanwhile, all the oils showed similar fatty acid profiles according to GC–MS analysis, regardless of the extraction method, indicating that AEUE is capable of S. mukorossi seed kernels oil extraction. In summary, the results from this study indicate that the developed AEUE is an efficient process for the separation of nonedible oil of for use in biodiesel production. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biomass such as switchgrass can be converted to renewable gasoline and diesel (RGD) fuels via integrated fast pyrolysis and hydrodeoxygenation. However, the low bulk density of biomass feedstocks produces relatively high transportation costs, driven by the large volumes needed to supply biorefineries. Densification can reduce transportation volumes, and therefore transportation costs for bioenergy production. However, the additional costs of biomass densification, along with decreases in overall mass and energy yields, influence the overall economic performance of RGD production. This study investigated the techno-economic impacts of pelletizing, torrefying, or pyrolyzing the biomass at distributed facilities prior to upgrading the intermediates to RGD at a centralized facility. Eight scenarios were considered. When there is no feedstock competition, biomass densification at the distributed facility was shown to reduce the transportation cost by 20%–50%. However, the capital and operating costs required for densifying biomass increased the total cost of RGD production by 3%–35% compared to RGD made from non-densified biomass. The cost of making RGD from densified biomass was only reduced below the cost of making RGD from non-densified biomass for the case when the fraction of land surrounding the biorefinery facility allocated to the biomass cultivation is less than 0.25. This finding is attributed to the high cost of transporting non-densified biomass from a larger procurement radius. Sensitivity analysis indicated that RGD fuel yield, densification costs, project investment, and the rate of return all have significant impacts on the overall economics of RGD production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel degradation is the modification of its original composition and properties as a result of fuel aging and metal corrosion during the storage process. This study examines the linkage between biodiesel degradation and the corrosion of stainless steel used to store the biodiesel. First, biodiesel was synthesized from soybean oil via methanolysis and ethanolysis homogeneous base-catalyzed transesterification routes. Next, immersion tests were carried out at room temperature, with little air turnover and in the dark. AISI 316 coupons were used to evaluate the corrosion of metal surfaces after contact with the biofuel. Changes in fuel composition were studied using FTIR and gas chromatography analysis, and the oxidative stability was analyzed by Rancimat and the peroxide index. The corrosion was evaluated by the gravimetric and SEM/EDS microscopy techniques and XRF analysis. Results revealed little influence of methyl and ethyl esters on metal degradation, indicating that routes have no importance on corrosion, since a low corrosion rate was observed for both esters, albeit with some surface micropitting. On the other hand, the presence of a small amount of metal ions released from the stainless steel surface during its corrosion promoted oxidation of the biodiesel, changing fuel composition and quality, as well as reducing its oxidative stability generally. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is an environment-friendly, alternative and renewable energy resource, synthesized from inexpensive seed oils of non-edible feedstock through transesterification reaction with alcohol and a homogenous base catalyst. In the current study, Taraxacum officinale seed oil (30% by weight) is investigated for physiochemical characterization and biodiesel production. FTIR and GC analysis was carried out to investigate chemical properties and fatty acid profile of methyl ester of Taraxacum officinale seed oil. Optimized parameters of alcohol to oil (1:4), catalyst concentration at temperature of 65 °C resulted in highest yield of 92%, in 60 min time using response surface methodology. In addition, comparison of fuel properties of synthesized biodiesel with ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 showed well-matched values. Our study thus recommends cultivation, cleaner production and utilization of Taraxacum officinale as a non-edible potential feedstock for biofuel production and industrial purposes. © 2019, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - Optimization of the operating factors to achieve the maximum yield of biodiesel through transesterification reaction was performed by using face-centered central composite design (FCCD) approach of response surface methodology. A total of 29 independent batch experiments were considered in this model to carefully observe the effect of operating factors, such as the volume ratio of methanol/oil, catalyst (KOH) weight percent, reaction temperature, and reaction time. The FCCD model predicted that a maximum yield of 99.5% biodiesel would be achieved from flaxseed oil at a reaction temperature of 59 °C, 0.51% catalyst, the reaction time of 33 min, and a molar ratio of methanol to flaxseed oil of 5.9:1. Experimental verification of the predicted yield under the optimum conditions gave a maximum yield of 98 ± 2%, which is in very good agreement with the predicted value of the model. The physicochemical properties of the flaxseed oil-derived biodiesel were compared with those of standard biodiesel to identify and verify the quality of the produced biodiesel. All observed physicochemical parameters of the flaxseed oil-derived biodiesel were closely in agreement with those of standard biodiesel. Thus, demonstrating that the production of high-quality biodiesel from flaxseed oil is a viable option. © 2019

AB  - The main objective of this work comprises the investigation of biodiesel production from rapeseed oil using potassium impregnated Fe3O4-CeO2 nanocatalyst. The various concentration of potassium impregnated Fe3O4-CeO2 was screened for catalytic conversion of rapeseed oil to triglyceride methyl ester. The 25 wt % potassium impregnated Fe3O4-CeO2 nanocatalyst showed best biodiesel production. Nanocatalyst was characterized by FTIR, XRD, SEM, TEM, BET and Hammett indicator for basicity test. The characterization of biodiesel was performed with GC-MS, 1H and 13C NMR. Moreover, the optimum reaction parameters such as catalyst amount (wt %), oil to methanol ratio, reaction time and reaction temperature for transesterification reaction was analyzed and yield was determined by 1H NMR. The maximum yield of 96.13% was obtained at 4.5 wt % catalyst amount, 1:7 oil to methanol ratio at 65 °C for 120 min. The properties of biodiesel such as acid value and kinematic viscosity were observed as 0.308 mg KOH/g and 4.37 mm2/s respectively. The other fuel parameters such as flash point and density were also determined. The reusability of catalyst was observed and it showed stability up to five cycles without considerable loss of activity. The recovery of excess methanol after transesterification reaction was achieved using distillation process setup. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Second generation biodiesel, so-called bio-hydrogenated diesel (BHD), can be produced from hydrotreatment of vegetable oils. The hydrogenation (HDO) of oleic acid and palmitic acid as model compounds of palm oil over unsupported Ni-Mo and Co-Mo sulfide catalysts was performed in a Parr reactor to produce BHD. The effects of reaction parameters: temperature, hydrogen pressure and the atomic ratio of catalysts (Ni/(Ni + Mo) or Co/(Co + Mo)) on the conversion and product yields (mainly n-C15, n-C16, n-C17 and n-C18 hydrocarbons) were evaluated. The results show that the high pressure favored HDO pathway, while high temperature strongly affected the decarboxylation and decarbonylation pathways. At optimal conditions for oleic acid HDO, the efficient catalyst was NiMoS2 catalyst (Ni/(Ni + Mo) = 0.2) which gave high oleic acid conversion (100%), n-C18 selectivity (78.8%) and n-C18 yield (70.3%) whereas, for palmitic acid HDO, NiMoS2 catalyst (Ni/(Ni + Mo) = 0.2) also gave high palmitic acid conversion (95.2%), n-C16 selectivity (78.5%) and n-C16 yield (65.6%). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The corrosive character of Moringa oleifera Lam biodiesel was evaluated through static immersion tests with different carbon steels (CS1015 and CS4140) in absence and presence of the antioxidant tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), at room temperature in the absence of light for 84 days. Biodiesel parameters, including oxidation stability (induction period, IP), total acid number (TAN) and iron concentration released from carbon steel, were monitored. The produced biodiesel presented an IP value of 4.9 h, which was increased to 6.2 h after the addition of 500 mg kg−1 TBHQ. After 84 days of immersion, IP values decreased in the first 21 days due to the contact with the metallic coupon, while TBHQ retarded this process. TAN value increased in 20% but the values were below the recommended limits (&lt;0.5 mg g−1 KOH according to EN14214). Iron was detected in the biodiesels exposed to CS1015 (8 μg g−1), while in the presence of TBHQ this value decreased to 5 μg g−1, indicating corrosion inhibition by TBHQ. Iron was not detected in the biodiesels exposed to CS4140, which indicated that this material was more compatible with biodiesel. Notably, the oxidation stability of Moringa biodiesel was not affected (IP &gt; 3 h) by the high Fe content. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This present work highlights the influence of injection timing (IT), injector opening pressure (IOP) and compression ratio (CR) on the combustion characteristics of a diesel engine operated on renewable and sustainable fuels. In this research work an effort has been made to enhance the combustion of fuel combination in a diesel engine with addition of carbon free hydrogen and in the direction of lowering the exhaust emission levels. Experimental investigations have been carried out to study the combustion and exhaust characteristics of a single cylinder, four stroke, direct injection (DI) diesel engine operated on Tri-fuel mode using Honge seed oil methyl ester (HsOME) as the injected fuel and producer gas-hydrogen mixture as the inducted fuel.. To minimize the number of experiments full factorial design (FFD) has been adopted. The response surface methodology (RSM) based quadratic models obtained through FFD have been established between the parameters and proposed characteristics. With hydrogen addition, response surface analysis showed that increasing CR, IOP with advanced IT significantly improves the combustion of HsOME-producer gas fueled diesel engine in terms of the enhanced brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and reduced carbon based emission levels (Smoke opacity, Carbon monoxide, Hydrocarbon) except the nitric oxide (NOx) emissions. Further combustion parameters such as Ignition delay (ID), and combustion duration were lowered with hydrogen addition, advanced IT, increased IOP and CR. In addition peak pressure and heat release rate (HRR) were found to be higher compared to base fuel combination. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper evaluates the feasibility of using fusion waste chicken and fish bones as the reusable and low cost solid catalyst for synthesis of biodiesel from used cooking oil via two-step transesterification. A catalyst characterization of the prepared fusion waste chicken and fish bones catalyst was made in order to study their catalytic performance through various techniques such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), Particle Size Analysis (PSA), Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA), Fourier Transform Infrared spectra (FTIR), Carbon Dioxide-Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD-CO2) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). The used cooking oil transesterification was optimized using a response surface methodology (RSM) based on five level three variables central composite design (CCD). The RSM results revealed that the optimal operational condition for the transesterification has defined as: catalyst loading, 1.98%w/v, reaction temperature, 65 °C and time, 1.54 h, whereas the alcohol/oil molar ratio, 10:1 is a fixed variable in this study. The actual biodiesel yield of 89.5% was achieved under the predicted optimal conditions and fulfilled the ASTM D6751 biodiesel fuel standards. The promising features of the chicken and fish bones catalyst are inexpensive, easily obtained, simple work-up, simple recovery, reusability without significant drop in catalytic activity for up to four consecutive runs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Glow-discharge plasma was utilized for treating the KOH/carbonated calcium aluminate synthesized by MCM. Treated and untreated nanocatalysts were characterized by XRD, FESEM, EDX-dot mapping, TEM, TGA/DSC, FTIR and N2 adsorption-desorption measurements. Moreover, some analyses were performed on the catalyst after assessment its catalytic activity in the microwave-assisted transesterification reaction. Treated and untreated nanocatalyst presented Ca12Al14O33 structure as support which was covered by carbon groups. The plasma treating was significantly effect on the potassium component as surface active phase and interaction of potassium and calcium with aluminium cations such that no agglomeration of active phases with the highest crystallinity was observed. The plasma treated sample showed better textural properties than untreated nanocatalyst. The main advantage of plasma was clearly observed on the stability of the nanocatalyst that the reduction the activity of untreated sample was more than two times of those for treated nanocatalyst. The plasma treated KOH/Ca12Al14O33-C exhibited no deformation of support structure and leaching of calcium component in the reaction medium against of untreated sample. Therefore, the plasma–microwave hybrid synthesis method provides an excellent rout for preparation of surface modified nanocatalysts for biodiesel production with the highest activity and stability to decrease the production cost. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A series of composite CaO-Ca3Al2O6 mixed oxides were investigated as potential catalysts for biodiesel synthesis from waste fish oil. Different Ca/Al ratios, in the range of 1.5–6 were studied, alongside pure CaO. The catalysts were characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and CO2-Temperature Program Desorption (TPD). The catalytic activity of the materials was studied for the transesterification reaction of cod liver oil with methanol at 65 °C, with 1:12 oil to methanol molar ratio and 10 wt% of catalyst. Over 97% conversion of the triglycerides to methyl esters was achieved for the 6Ca/Al catalyst after 2 h reaction time. This was similar to the performance of CaO. However, 6Ca/Al catalyst was reused successfully for seven consecutive tests, in contrast to CaO that was reused for only five tests, before it deactivated. Therefore, by incorporating the Ca3Al2O6, it was possible to enhance the stability of the catalytically active species and improve the lifetime of the catalyst. Post-test catalyst characterisation showed the formation of an intermediate phase (calcium diglyceroxide) that enhanced the catalyst's performance and tolerance to air exposure and humidity. Finally, the catalyst deactivation, after seven cycles, took place due to the formation of Ca(OH)2 and CaCO3 species. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Novel sulfonated magnetic solid acid catalysts (ZrFe-SA-SO3H) with both Bronsted and Lewis sites were synthesized, which provided both a high density of surface acidity (4.4–8.4 mmol/g) and considerable magnetization (3.7–8.1 Am2/kg). The synthesized catalysts were characterized by elemental analysis, XRD, ICP-OES, FT-IR, BET, SEM-EDX, TEM, TG-DSC, VSM and Boehm titration. The prepared catalysts were tested in the esterification of oleic acid, with high yields of biodiesel (92.7–99.5%) for the first catalytic cycle at 90 °C for 4 h. A High biodiesel yield of 90.3% was still achieved after five cycles of Zr1.0Fe1.0-SA-SO3H. A similar situation was also observed when using sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) to replace SA during catalyst preparation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Two-stage injection with different biodiesel percentage is investigated where first and second injections were implemented with different SOI timings at various mass ratio under constant speed of 2000 rpm and 60 Nm of torque. The results reveal that maximum BTE of 32.4% and minimum BSFC of 245.5 g/kWh can be achieved simultaneously with injection mass ratio of 50:50 at advanced SOI timing using baseline diesel. A considerably lower level of NOx below 90 ppm is achievable via late SOI timing by using B20 or B50 biodiesel blends with injection mass ratio of 25:75. Specifically, the lowest NOx of 82 ppm can be achieved with smoke emission level still remains below 5% when B50 biodiesel blend and 25:75 injection mass ratio is tested. The highest reduction of 5.3% of smoke compared to diesel was achieved when B50 was used with 50:50 mass ratio at retarded SOI of 2°ATDC. It was found that simultaneous NOx and smoke reduction compared to that of fossil diesel is feasible with the application of B50 biodiesel blend and execution of retarded SOI timing and injection mass ratio of 25:75. Lastly, two-stage fuel injection is a practical strategy to simultaneously decrease NOx and smoke emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a promising technique of producing crude bio-oil (biocrude) from wet biomass. This work conducted the co-HTLs of microalgae (chlorella) and sewage sludge (SS) at 340 °C, 18 MPa, 0.3 MPa of initial H2 addition, 30 min of residence time under different feedstock mass ratios conditions, and explored the effects of three kinds of SS ashes on biocrude properties during microalgae HTL for the first time. Corresponding biocrude yields, elemental compositions, higher heating values, energy recoveries, boiling point distributions, and compound compositions were examined systematically. The results show that there was a certain synergistic effect on the improvement of biocrude yield other than biocrude quality in the co-HTL of microalgae and SS, especially at the 1:1 of mass ratio condition. This co-HTL could improve the actual biocrude yield by 4.7 wt% and decrease the actual solids yield by 3.6 wt% in contrast to corresponding theoretical yields. The pyrolysis-state SS ash could reduce the N and O contents, increase the C and H contents and HHV, and improve the proportion of low-boiling-point (&lt;250 °C) compounds in the biocrude from microalgae HTL, while the oxidation-state or reduction-state SS ash was able to increase biocrude yield by approximately 3.3 wt%. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, natural diatomaceous earth was utilized for the preparation of efficient lithium metasilicate (Li2SiO3) catalyst for biodiesel production via the transesterification of soybean oil and waste cooking oil. Lithium metasilicate was successfully synthesized from the hydrothermal reaction of natural diatomite in LiOH solutions at 150 °C for 24 h and, subsequently, by calcination at 500 °C for 6 h. Both fresh and spent Li2SiO3 catalysts were characterized by using XRD, 29Si NMR, BET, ICP-OES and acid-base titration. The acidity of the soybean oil and waste cooking oil used in this study was 0.54 mg KOH/g oil and 1.67 mg KOH/g oil, respectively. The yields of biodiesel from soybean oil reached ca. 80.3% in 1 h, respectively, in presence of catalyst at 3 wt% of oil used. Generally, more catalyst present would lead to a higher yield of biodiesel. With the mass loading of catalyst-to-oil at 0.05, the activation energy of the catalyzed transesterification using Li2SiO3 catalyst was 61.65 kJ/mol. The durability test of the Li2SiO3 catalysts was conducted in the same system. A high catalytic activity after being reused for 19 times was observed with a yield of biodiesel near ca. 85% after 4 h of the transesterification reaction at 60 °C. The deactivation mechanism of the Li2SiO3 catalyst was mainly attributed to the loss of surface base sites coincident with more Q4 and less Q2 Si atoms in catalyst after reaction, as found by 29Si NMR. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The authors report on the economic impacts of introducing woody biomass processing in an economically distressed, but heavily forested Central Appalachian U.S. region. Woody biomass is a readily available unconventional energy source that has the potential to boost the rural region’s economy. They use a static regional computable general equilibrium model to assess long-run economic impacts of two woody biomass processing production pathways of biomass to ethanol through fermentation and biomass to biofuel through fast pyrolysis. While the 232 to 370 jobs and $13 million to $21 million income might seem small relative to the multicounty region, the localized impact on the county in which the facility would be sited, even for the direct jobs and income impacts, would be much more substantial. The authors conclude that woody biomass processing is a viable economic development option for the study area and similar rural regions. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Zirconia modified mesoporous silica such as Zr-SBA-15, Zr-KIT-6, Zr-SiO2, and Zr-FSM-16 with Si/Zr = 10 ratio over Ni-MoS catalysts were prepared under the hydrothermal condition and compared with Ni-MoS/Zr-Al (10). The prepared materials were characterized by various techniques like X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), N2-sorption studies, diffuse reflectance measurement–UV-Vis spectrophotometers (DR-UV-vis), NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD)/H2-Temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), Laser-Raman, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) techniques. The activity of materials was investigated in hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of jojoba oil to produce long-chain hydrocarbons at 225–375 °C under 10–40 bar H2 pressure in a stainless steel fixed bed reactor. Among the catalysts tested, Ni-MoS/Zr-K (10) exhibited the highest catalytic activity of 90% conversion and 79% yield of C18–C22 hydrocarbon. The structure-activity relationships and product distributions were also discussed in detail. © 2019

AB  - In this study, the effect of biodiesel premixing on emission, combustion characteristics and engine performance was numerically investigated via AVL Fire. In order to confirm the validity of the study, combustion inside the chamber was simulated in a condition in which the fuel was pure diesel, and the results were compared with results presented in other work. Engine performance parameters and emissions were in a very good agreement with those reported in other research works. After the validity of the engine achieved, in the first phase of the study, pure diesel fuel and the mixture of diesel-biodiesel blends were injected to the chamber without premixing. In the next phase, pure biodiesel and biodiesel blends were premixed within the chamber and the effect of premixing on the interesting parameters was investigated. Results showed that premixing biodiesel leads to a reduction in the soot emission and increment in the NOx emission. In addition to this, using pure diesel as the main injected fuel and pure biodiesel as the premixed fuel decreased soot emission considerably. Besides, unlike biodiesel blends, it did not increase NOx emission considerably. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In these studies, the microwave-assisted transesterification of non-edible Papaya oil was investigated under the fixed microwave power of 700 W and constant magnetic stirring. Optimization of the yield of Papaya oil methyl ester was investigated using response surface methodology. Within the range of the selected operating conditions, the optimized values of temperature, catalyst amount, time, and methanol to oil molar ratio were found to be 62.33 °C, 0.95 wt %, 3.30 min, and 9.50:1 respectively. Current studies revealed that the methanol to oil molar ratio and temperature have significant effects on microwave-assisted transesterification of Papaya oil. The high values of R2 97.72 and R2adj 95.60 indicate that the fitted model shows a good agreement with the predicted and actual FAME yield. Based on the optimum condition, the predicted biodiesel yield was 99.9% and the actual experimental value was 99.3%. Papaya oil methyl ester (POME) exhibits property close to ASTM standards. In conclusion, these studies revealed that biodiesel obtained from Papaya seed oil feedstock has a potential to use as an alternative of diesel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Nowadays, macroalgae are widely discussed as advantageous alternative feedstock for crude bio-oil production using pyrolysis. In the present work, pyrolysis products of Enteromorpha clathrata washed with 7% phosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid were studied. In general, washing with diluted acids resulted in significant increase in the yields of bio-oil and non-condensable gas over the control in favor of the bio-char. In addition, HCl pretreatment enhanced the relative contents of aliphatic hydrocarbons in the bio-oil by 1.5 times over the control. Furthermore, HCl pretreatment showed 37% and 52.6% reduction in acids and oxygen-containing compounds, respectively, with respect to the control. FTIR analysis showed that acid-washing led to reduction in O–H stretching vibration, confirming that it can disrupt hydroxyl bonds reducing phenols, carboxylic acids and water impurities in the bio-oil. In conclusion, washing of biomass using diluted acids could play a key role to enhance the bio-oil yield and significantly influence products characteristics; particularly, HCl enhanced bio-oil yield with higher aliphatic hydrocarbons proportion. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study aims to investigate the interaction during co-pyrolysis of Polypropylene (PP) and Rice bran wax (RBW). Initial characterization of feedstock was found to be suitable to carry out further experimental sets. Further, the pyrolysis experiments of PP, RBW and different blends (1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 2:1 and 3:1) were carried out in a semi-batch reactor. As per TGA analysis the temperature range between 400 °C and 650 °C at a constant heating rate of 25 °C/min was determined. The maximum liquid yield of PP, RBW was approximately 76%, 86% at the temperature of 500 °C and 600 °C respectively. Whereas maximum liquid yield from co‒pyrolysis was obtained at 1:3 blend i.e. 81% at 550 °C. GC‒MS results inferred the highest percentage of hydrocarbon whereas 1:3 blends has lower oxygen containing groups than RBW in liquid products. FTIR data of all blends indicates higher range of alkyl and aromatic compounds. H1 NMR results also confirmed the higher compounds into aliphatic region than aromatics or heteroaromatics groups. Further, most of the fuel properties of 1:3 blend falls within the range of gasoline and diesel properties. Study was extended to know crystallization behaviour of fuel by DSC analysis from two consecutive heating and cooling cycles of −50 to 60 °C and reversed till −50 °C at 10 °C min −1. Two peaks at −24 °C and 26 °C were observed during heating cycle whereas single peak at 23 °C during cooling cycle. 1:3 blend residual char characterization was also included in the work. Unfortunately, the SEM and BET results inferred that the char was not highly porous. © 2018 Energy Institute

AB  - Production of liquid biofuels derived from vegetable oils in recent years significantly increased which causes surplus of by-product (waste glycerol) from this process. Therefore it is of great importance to find cheap and fast method of use its utilization. In this study, a possibility of the utilization of technical purity glycerin as an addition to wood pellets intended for heating purposes has been investigated. Usefulness of pellets contained glycerol additions has been compared in terms of applicable quality standards for wood pellets. Effects of waste glycerol addition on concentration of combustion products as well as temperature in heat exchanger have also been examined. The experimental results show that co-combustion of waste glycerol with wood sawdust does not worsen heating efficiency in a standard boiler. Moreover, 4.5 and 7% presence of glycerol in wood pellets correlated to a nearly twofold decrease of NOx concentration in flue gas. Therefore, the use of the waste glycerol as a binder for the production of pellets can be a simple and cost-effective solution of its utilization. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - This research article aims to analyze the properties and characteristics of the products obtained from slow pyrolysis of wood barks of matured Calophyllum inophyllum (CI) tree. The bio-oil, gas and biochar obtained from the slow pyrolysis carried out at 550 °C in a fixed bed batch type reactor at a heating rate of 30 °C min−1 were characterized by different analytical techniques. Owing to the lofty volatile content of CI biomass (72.61%), it was chosen as the raw material in this current experimental investigation. FT-IR and GC–MS results of bio-oil showed the existence of elevated amount phenol derivatives, oxygenated compounds, acids, esters and furans. The physicochemical properties of the bio-oil sample were tested in accordance with ASTM standards which clearly showed that bio-oil is a highly viscous liquid with lower heating value as compared to that of diesel fuel. The chemical composition of pyrolytic gas was analyzed by using Gas Chromatography which revealed the presence of combustible organic components. The FT-IR results of biochar showed the presence of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons whereas the increased amount of carbon in biochar reveals its potential to be used as solid fuel for commercial purposes. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This paper replicates the study of Zhang et al. (2010): “Food versus fuel: What do prices tell us?” Energy Policy 38, pp. 445-451. We confirm the findings of the original paper that there was only a weak relationship between ethanol and food commodities in the period between March 1989 and July 2008. In addition, we extend that study and examine the cointegration relationship between biofuels and related commodities for a considerably enlarged dataset (3 vs. 1 market, 26 vs. 8 commodities, analysis up till 2017 vs. 2008, weekly vs. monthly data frequency). Focusing on the biofuel markets of Brazil, the EU and the USA in the three separate periods before, during, and after the food crisis of 2007 and 2008, we show that studying the time variation of the relationships plays an essential role in their proper understanding. Our results help to clarify the wide extensive discussion about the role of biofuels prices in food shortages manifested particularly during the food crises. In agreement with the original study, we confirm that price series data do not support strong statements about biofuels uniformly serving as main leading source of high food prices and consequently the food shortages. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Abstract: Owing to the fast depletion of fossil fuels and their skyrocketing price due to the tremendous demand, they become imperative to find renewable alternative fuels for diesel engines. Vegetable oils and their mix with diesel in various proportions, called biodiesel, have been found to be very useful in reducing the alarming consumption of fossil fuels. In the present investigation, lemongrass oil is used as an alternative fuel. The availability of lemongrass oil is adequate for Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The coating material chosen is the partially stabilized zirconium because it has low thermal conductivity and high thermal coefficient. The piston top face, cylinder head, inlet valve and the outlet valve are coated. The purpose of low heat rejection engine or coated engine during the combustion process less heat is rejected by insulating materials. In the current work, the experiment is carried out with lemongrass oil with water emulsion and diesel in a four-stroke direct ignition engine with coating and without coating at various load conditions. The diesel engine run with lemongrass oil–water emulsion (94% LGO + 5% water + 1% surfactant), and low heat rejection engine performed better and gave better brake thermal efficiency compared with raw lemongrass oil–water emulsion blend at peak load. Then, the brake-specific fuel consumption of lemongrass oil–water emulsion in the coated engine was 325 (g kW−1 h−1) which was lower than that of lemongrass oil–water emulsion (94% LGO + 5% water + 1% surfactant) in the uncoated engine. Further, combustion parameter of lemongrass oil–water emulsion blend tested in coated engine produced 60 bars in-cylinder pressure, and it was better than lemongrass oil–water emulsion in the uncoated engine. Both the cumulative heat release rate and the heat release rate were in superior range compared with lemongrass oil–water emulsion in the uncoated engine. As regards tailpipe emission, the lemongrass oil–water emulsion blend in the coated engine at peak load delivered a steep reduction in carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon and smoke emission of base diesel blend in the uncoated engine. But, on the contrary, NOx and CO2 emissions were steeply higher compared with the diesel blend that powered the uncoated engine. The entire tested parameters led to the conclusion that lemongrass oil–water emulsion used in the coated diesel engine would be a healthier and economical substitute fuel for hydrocarbonated fuels.

AB  - Exhaust gases from internal combustion engines contain fine carbon particles. If a biofuel is used as the engine fuel for low-carbon emission, the exhaust gas still contains numerous carbon particles. For example, the ceramic filters currently used in automobiles with diesel engines trap these carbon particles, which are then burned during the filter regeneration process, thus releasing additional CO2. Electrostatic precipitators are generally suitable to achieve low particle concentrations and large treatment quantities. However, low-resistivity particles, such as carbon particles, cause re-entrainment phenomena in electrostatic precipitators. In this study, we develop an electrostatic precipitator to collect fine carbon particles. Woodceramics were used for the grounded electrode in the precipitator to collect carbon particles on the carbon electrode. Woodceramics are eco-friendly materials, made from sawdust. The electrical resistivity and surface roughness of the woodceramics are varied by the firing temperature in the production process. Woodceramics electrodes feature higher resistivity and roughness as compared to stainless-steel electrodes. We evaluated the influence of woodceramics electrodes on the electric field formed by electrostatic precipitators and calculated the corresponding charge distribution. Furthermore, the particle-collection efficiency of the developed system was evaluated using an experimental apparatus. © 2019 by the authors.

Microorganisms with the capacity to produce medium-chain alkanes are promising for the bio-production of drop-in fuel. We found that Klebsiella sp. NBRC100048 has the ability to produce medium-chain alkanes from medium-chain aldehydes. We cloned a gene involved in conversion of aldehydes to alkanes by using a genomic fosmid library derived from Klebsiella sp. NBRC100048. The gene termed orf2991 encodes 506 amino acids and shows 62% sequence homology to the aldehyde dehydrogenase of Escherichia coli, aldB. The finding of orf2991 as a novel alkane-synthesizing enzyme gene similar to E. coli aldehyde dehydrogenase family, which is generally known to catalyze a reaction oxidizing aldehydes to fatty acids, indicated a novel function of aldehyde dehydrogenase. This finding is not only significant academically but allows developing the novel manufacturing methods of alkanes fermentation. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study explores the environmental, economic, and technical feasibility of using spent coffee grounds as parent feedstock for biodiesel production. Biodiesel is produced from the spent coffee grounds, and four blends are prepared—B5, B10, B15, and B20. The effects of two extraction solvents (hexane and petroleum ether) on oil yields of the spent coffee grounds are investigated, employing the Soxhlet extraction technique. The properties of any intermediate yield throughout the production process are characterised and adjusted by post processes to ensure the conformity of the final biodiesel product with the standards (ASTM D6751 and ISO EN14214). The major part of the study investigates the effects of blends on tailpipe emissions and performance of a naturally aspirated single-cylinder compression ignition engine. A wide range of engine speeds (1600–3600 rpm at 200-rpm increments) has been considered at three engine loads (100, 75, and 50%). The standard diesel fuel is set as a basis for comparison. Results show that the post processes on the extracted oil yielded water content of 0.038%, free fatty acid fraction of 0.41%, and acid number of &lt;2 mg KOH/g. The highest oil extraction (14.12%) was obtained over a 45-min extraction time using a hexane solvent. Biodiesel blends produced lower levels of CO 2 , CO, and HC. Blend B5 showed average reductions of 0.34, 12.5, and 4.23% at full load for the three aforementioned emissions, respectively; B10 reductions were 3.12, 29.85, and 19.14%, respectively. Higher levels of NO x emissions were detected from all blends. At full load, the average NO x increments of B5, B10, B15, and B20 were 0.35, 1.28, 1.8, and 2.3%, respectively. The outstanding environmental and ecological benefits of using the spent coffee grounds as a potential feedstock for biodiesel production are apparent. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. is an inedible plant whose seed oil is an interesting source for biodiesel production. Seed cake, the main byproduct remaining (about 70% w/w)after the oil extraction process, has a high nutritional value but the presence in Jatropha curcas seed of phorbol esters (PEs), a family of toxic compounds with a tigliane skeleton, prevents application of seed cake and other byproducts (e.g. glycerin)in animal feed without an efficient detoxification. Considering the high toxicity of PEs, it is important to have a sensitive analytical method to evaluate the presence of these compounds in Jatropha curcas derivatives. In this paper we present the study of the ESI-MS/MS fragmentation pattern of the [M+Na]+ ion at m/z 733.5 of the six known PEs, namely Jatropha factors (JFs)C1-C6, which allowed to tentatively identify a series of characteristic and specific fragment ions useful to reveal the presence of JFs in Jatropha curcas seed oil, distinguish them from each other, and identify new PEs (J1-J4). Moreover, the substitution of the usual acetonitrile/water as mobile phase with a mixture of methanol/water (85:15, v/v)allowed to increase the signal of the sodium adduct of about 50-fold during the HPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Research has intensified toward the production of biofuels due to increased economic uncertainty and environmental issues associated with petroleum fuel production. A fifth of the global energy demand is derived from transportation fuels such as diesel, jet fuel, and gasoline. Most of the research in literature focuses on the production of biodiesel to supplement petroleum-based diesel. This review evaluates and compares three methods: (1) hydroprocessing, (2) pyrolysis (catalytic cracking), and (3) transesterification to determine the ideal, and simultaneous, biogasoline and biojet fuel production technique from castor oil, a nonedible vegetable oil. The methods are compared on the ability to produce biofuels using in spark-ignition engine or/and aviation. Edible oils have been thoroughly investigated as a biofuel feedstock, which competes with food sources, hence the requirement to switch the focus to nonedible oils. From extensive research, it is clear that transesterification is not adequate on its own. Hydrocracking is the ideal solution as it can simultaneously produce high-quality biojet fuel and biogasoline using one catalyst. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Vinasse, from sugar and ethanol production, stands out as one of the most problematic agroindustry wastes due to its high chemical oxygen demand, large production volume, and recalcitrant compounds. Therefore, the viability of using glycerin as a co-substrate in vinasse anaerobic digestion was tested, to increase process efficiency and biogas productivity. The effect of feeding strategy, influent concentration, cycle length, and temperature were assessed to optimize methane production. Glycerin (1.53% v/v) proved to be a good co-substrate since it increased the overall methane production in co-digestion assays. CH4 productivity enhanced exponentially as influent concentration increased, but when temperature was increased to 35 °C, biogas production was impaired. The highest methane productivity and yield were achieved using fed-batch mode, at 30 °C and at an organic loading rate of 10.1 kg COD m−3 day−1: 139.32 mol CH4 m−3 day−1, 13.86 mol CH4 kg CODapplied, and 15.30 mol CH4 kg CODremoved. Methane was predominantly produced through the hydrogenotrophic route. In order to treat all the vinasse produced by a mid-size sugar and ethanol plant, nine reactors with 7263.4 m3 each would be needed. The energy generated by burning the biogas in boilers would reach approximately 92,000 MW h per season and could save up to US$ 240,000.00 per month in diesel oil demand. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In this study, life cycle analysis (LCA) has been applied to evaluate the environmental impacts of biogas production and utilisation substituting for grid electricity, natural gas grid and transport fuels, with a focus on Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. The results demonstrate significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for the biogas as a fuel scenario due to the displacement of fossil petrol and diesel fuels (scenario 3), with savings of between 524 and 477 kg of CO2 equivalent (per MWh of energy provided by the fuels). The utilisation of biogas for electricity generation saves around 300 kg of CO2 equivalent per MWh of electricity injected into the grid (scenario 1), while Scenario 2, the upgrading of biogas to biomethane and its injection into the gas grid for heating saves 191 kg of CO2 equivalent (per MWh of energy generated by the biomethane). The results emphasise the benefits of using life cycle analysis to provide an evidence based for bioenergy policy. The limitations of the research are identified and recommendations made for future research priorities to further the use of LCA in the evaluation of bioenergy systems. © 2019

AB  - This work examines the effect of butanol (higher alcohol) on the emission pattern of neat neem oil biodiesel (NBD100) fueled diesel engine. Single-cylinder, 4-stroke, research diesel engine was employed to conduct the trial. Blends comprising the mixture of biodiesel and higher alcohol were prepared by employing an ultrasonic agitator. Four test fuels such as neat neem oil biodiesel, diesel, and two blends of higher alcohol/neem oil biodiesel: 10% and 20% (by volume). Experimental result showed that increasing alcohol content to biodiesel brought down the various emissions such as Smoke, NOx, HC, and CO by 6.8%, 10.4%, 8.6%, and 5.9%, respectively, at all loads. It was also concluded from the trail that a 20% higher alcohol/neem oil biodiesel blends show the promising signs in reducing all the emissions associated with biodiesel fuelled diesel engine. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Microalgae is one of the most promising feedstocks for biofuel production because it yields the high content of sugar and oil. In order to help to develop this nascent industry, this paper proposes a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for planning and designing a microalgae-based biobutanol supply chain network. The goal of this study is minimizing the fixed cost of constructing required facilities, transportation costs, and operational costs (harvesting, pretreatment, treatment, and energy conversion). This paper considers supply, production, distribution, and addresses a multi-period model. Since the volume of harvested and dried algae cannot be determined accurately, a fuzzy programming approach is employed to address uncertainties. Additionally, a data envelopment analysis (DEA) method is used to reduce the complexity of solving the proposed model. The applicability of the model is evaluated through a real case study of Iran. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The spray and combustion characteristics of biodiesel-ethanol blends were experimentally investigated by using electrospray atomization in a meso-scale combustor. Phase Doppler anemometry measurements were employed to obtain droplet size distribution. Optical measurements were carried out to quantify the electrospray structures. With the addition of ethanol, the spray angle increased and the droplet size decreased from 128 μm to 12 μm. The polydisperse spray of the biodiesel-ethanol blends with a low ethanol blending ratio yielded the bimodal distribution in droplet size due to Coulomb fission. Relative standard deviation of monodisperse droplets is below 15%. The combustion of the blends was performed in a meso-scale combustor with a 12 mm inner diameter. The flame can be stabilized near the mesh in the combustor without any external heating. It was found that the spray structures have a direct effect on the flame structures in spray combustion. 40% ethanol addition (BE40) has the best combustion performance compared to other blends. The results show that the flame of BE40 has a broader stabilization limit both in flow velocity and equivalence ratio. The reduction of the droplet size for the blends with high ethanol blending ratio results in the decrease of CO emission. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present study, the effects of water emulsion and diethyl ether additive on the combustion performance and emissions of a compression ignition engine using biodiesel blends are investigated on a four stroke, single cylinder diesel engine. The emulsification technique is used to reduce the oxides of nitrogen emission. Biodiesel is produced from waste cooking oil and blended with mineral diesel to form different blend compositions. The water in oil emulsion is prepared by adding 5% (vol) water in the presence of 2% Span 80 surfactant. Diethyl ether is used to improve the combustion efficiency of the emulsified blends. The results show that, compared to biodiesel operation, the brake thermal efficiency of the emulsified fuel increases slightly with the composition of diethyl ether, and the maximum brake thermal efficiency is obtained at 2% diethyl ether. Lower oxides of nitrogen are observed for all emulsion fuels compared to biodiesel operation for all load conditions. Lower emissions of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon and smoke are observed for emulsions, and minimum values are obtained for a 2% diethyl ether composition. The use of water emulsion reduces the oxides of nitrogen whereas the oxygenated fuel additive is responsible for the reduction of other emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The feedstock has been the most significant issue for promoting a sustainable and economical renewable aviation fuel in Taiwan. In this study, the potential feedstocks available for producing hydro-processed renewable jet (HRJ) fuel locally in Taiwan were evaluated economically through the process simulation and techno-economic analysis. The productivities, H2 consumptions, product distributions and properties of the produced fuel, which strongly depend on the fatty acid content within the oil/fat feedstocks, were demonstrated and discussed. The baseline economics, sensitivity analyses and pioneer plant analyses were also conducted in accordance with the simulation results. The minimum aviation fuel selling prices (MAFPs) of all feedstocks were calculated ranging from $0.91/L∼ $2.74/L. The feedstock costs, prices of hydrogen, prices of hydro-processing catalyst and plant capacities have influences on the selling prices of renewable aviation fuel by 54%, 18%, 12% and 11%, respectively. Furthermore, although the greases have the most economical benefits among the selected feedstocks, the feedstock pretreatment processes lead to the complexity of the production and result in higher pioneer plant costs compared to the ones of plant oils. This study provides the suggestions for the government to locally select an appropriate HRJ feedstock. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work examines the feasibility of fuelling biodiesel derived from water hyacinth in a compression ignition engine. This work also proposes water hyacinth biodiesel (WHB) as a potential alternative energy source since the above species is available extensively in freshwater, marine and aquatic ecosystems throughout the world. WHB was blended with petroleum diesel fuel at various volume proportions of 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 100% and their properties were analyzed as per ASTM standards for its application as biofuel in diesel engine. The prepared test fuels were analyzed experimentally in a single cylinder diesel engine at constant speed (1500 rev/min) for its performance, combustion and emission characteristics. Test results projected that, the characteristics of 20% WHB +80% diesel fuel blend was in par with neat diesel fuel in terms of thermal efficiency, HC, CO and smoke emissions. However, WHB blends resulted in slightly higher levels of CO2 and NOx emissions. At full load, the attained cylinder pressure and heat release rate of WHB blends were closer to the diesel fuel. Thus, the present work identifies the novel water hyacinth biodiesel as a viable biofuel for diesel engine applications towards sustainable environment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The purpose of this work was to investigate the viability of a microalgae catalytic pyrolysis/hydrotreating plant to kerosene, diesel and gasoline using Aspen Plus. A series of 2000 dry tonne per day scenarios were simulated with the final goal of determine the price in USD per litre of the drop-in fuels produced and the economic feasibility of the technique at a large-scale. Different scenarios (mechanical, solar and thermal drying), microalgae (Nannochloropsis and Isochrysis)and catalysts (Li-LSX zeolite, Ni-Ce/Al2O3, Ni-Ce/ZrO2). For this work, a systematic design approach by Douglas was considered and the whole process was actualised with the Marshall and Swift Cost Index of 2016. The lowest minimum fuel selling price (1.418 $/L)was found for Isochrysis and Li-LSX-zeolite. Finally, the sensitivity analysis showed that the bio-oil yield was the most influent factor, leading to a variation of the fuel price between 1.158 $/L to 1.751 $/L assuming a 20% of variation. The techno-economic assessment and sensitivity analysis indicated that Isochrysis and Li-LSX-zeolites are promising for the production of drop-in fuels, but further research is required to further reduce the price of the feedstock production and drying to be competitive with lignocellulosic materials. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The main task of this study is to perform a complex analysis dealing with influence of biodiesel and its mixture on regulated and unregulated gaseous emissions of diesel engine, which is installed in a motorcar as a driving unit determined for standard road traffic. As a real technical platform intended for realisation of the required experiments, a motor vehicle equipped with the TDI engine was chosen because just this kind of engine was directly affected by the affair “dieselgate”. This type of piston combustion engine is widely used in the traffic, together with negative impacts on the air quality. Various diesel fuel mixtures, which represented the applied experimental fuels, were created by mixing of the ultra-low sulphur diesel fuel (ULSDF) with the biodiesel, using different mixture ratios. The individual experiments were performed during a 13-mode test cycle especially developed for the diesel engine in such a way, so that it was possible to identify influence of the engine loading and engine speed on the regulated and unregulated gaseous emissions of the given TDI diesel engine. It is possible to say according to the obtained results that a higher portion of the biodiesel in the fuel mixture reduces the amount of the hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matters (PM) in the gaseous emissions, but it increases volume of the nitrogen oxides (NOX). A higher portion of the biodiesel causes a growth of the formaldehyde emissions and acetaldehyde emissions in the case of unregulated diesel engine emissions. The same trend is also typical for the 1,3-butadiene, propene and ethene. The biodiesel additive increases emissions of benzene; however, it reduces emissions of the toluene and xylene within the aromatic substance emissions. The obtained results confirm a fact that all the gaseous emissions are influenced by the engine operational regimes, especially by the engine loading status. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Commercial palm oil-derived biodiesel fuels (palm BDFs) were thoroughly profiled based on the specifications of international fuel standards. Their main components were found to be fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) with different numbers of double bonds in the fatty acid tails in addition to small amounts of unreactive glycerides and impurities, the concentrations of which varied slightly among the regional producers in Thailand. The fuel properties of the as-received commercial palm BDFs met international fuel standards; unfortunately, the fuel degraded significantly over time, presumably due to the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acid methyl esters (poly-FAME) and impurities. To prevent this degradation, the commercial palm BDFs were upgraded into partially hydrogenated fatty acid methyl esters with outstanding oxidation stability (H-FAME, a new type of biodiesel fuel enriched in monounsaturated fatty acid methyl esters (mono-FAME)) over supported Pd catalysts with metallic Pd nanoparticles as the catalytically active sites in a batch-type glass reactor under mild conditions (80 °C and 0.5 MPa H2). In the upgrading process, the unwanted component poly-FAME, which had low oxidation stability, was selectively converted into the target component, mono-FAME with high oxidation stability. Although the impurities in the commercial palm BDFs poisoned the supported Pd catalysts, particularly the sulfur species, the homemade mesoporous silica-supported Pd catalyst with a high Pd dispersion of 47% gave higher activity and tolerance to the impurities in the synthesis of palm H-FAMEs than the commercial alumina-supported Pd catalyst, which had a low Pd dispersion of 16%. In the accelerated oxidation stability test, the B20 fuels formulated by blending petro-diesel with the palm H-FAMEs with enhanced oxidation stability produced almost no deposits or sludges, whereas the fuels formulated by blending petro-diesel with commercial palm BDFs were seriously degraded and acidified, and formed deposits and sludges. Moreover, the palm H-FAMEs could be further purified by selective removal of the monoglycerides (MG) and steryl glucosides (SG) through wintering and adsorption posttreatments, and were determined to be a reliable BDF source with high safety and security for use in high blend fuels. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study compared the performance of microalga growth, nutrient removal, algal organic matter, and energy storage products in mixotrophic, photoautotrophic, and heterotrophic conditions. Scenedesmus obliquus was used as a model species. Mixotrophic condition showed the highest specific growth rate of 0.96 d−1 as well as the fastest nitrogen and phosphorus removal rate of 85.17 mg-N g-cell−1 day−1 and 11.49 mg-P g-cell−1 day−1, respectively, compared with photoautotrophic and heterotrophic conditions. Mixotrophic microalgae had relatively higher carbohydrates and lipids contents (21.8 and 24.0%) than photoautotrophic and heterotrophic conditions. Meanwhile, algal organic matter (AOM) in the medium was produced at the highest level under photoautotrophic condition. Mixotrophic condition was more efficient in terms of microalga growth, nutrient removal, production of energy storage products, and suppression of AOM, and would be adaptable for wastewater treatment process. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Microalgal lipid production by Chlorella protothecoides using sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate was investigated in this study. First, maximum glucose and reducing sugar concentrations of 15.2 and 27.0 g/L were obtained in sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate (SCBH), and the effects of different percentages of glucose and xylose on algal cultivation were investigated. Afterwards, SCBH was used as a carbon source for the cultivation of C. protothecoides and higher biomass concentration of 10.7 g/L was achieved. Additionally, a large amount of fatty acids, accounting up to 16.8% of dry weight, were accumulated in C. protothecoides in the nitrogen-limited (0.1–1 mmol/L) culture. Although SCBH inhibited fatty acid accumulation to a certain degree and the inhibition was aggravated by nitrogen starvation, SCBH favored microalgal cell growth and fatty acid production. The present study is of significance for the integration of cost-effective feedstocks production for biodiesel with low-cost SCBH as well as environmentally friendly disposal of lignocellulosic wastes. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Given the significance of the relationships between human beings, environment, machines and ergonomics as well as the necessity of using renewable fuels, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of different blends of biodiesel, bioethanol and diesel on noise pollution emitted by a MF285 tractor in stationary and moving modes by the aid of statistical methods. In this respect, the emitted noise was measured using the noise dosimeters and sound level meters in the driver and the bystander's positions, at 1000, 1600 and 2000 RPM in both stationary and moving modes. Then, nine fuel blends of biodiesel, bioethanol and diesel with different volumetric percentages as well as pure diesel were studied. To study the effects of key factors on noise pollution, the factorial experiment was conducted in the form of a completely randomized design, followed by the application of the SPSS Statistics Software Version 19.0. The fuel type nearly affected the noise pollution at the level of 5%, and other factors such as engine rotational speed and the fuel type-engine rotational speed interaction influenced it at the level of 1%. In both the driver and bystander's positions, the minimum and maximum noise pollution occurred at 1000 and 2000 RPM, respectively. The effects of gears along with their twofold and threefold interaction with other factors were not significant. Finally, the results of the present study demonstrated that the B25E4D71 fuel, composed of 25% biodiesel and 4% bioethanol, had the lowest noise pollution. © 2019 Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is a promising route for the upgrading of bio-oils to eco-friendly biofuel produced from lignocellulose. Herein, we report the sequential synthesis of a hybrid nanocatalyst CoxP@POP, where substoichiometric CoxP nanoparticles are distributed in a porous organic polymer (POP) via solid-state phosphidation of the Co3O4@POP nanohybrid system. We also explored the catalytic activity of the above two nanohybrids toward the HDO of vanillin, a typical compound of lignin-derived bio-oil to 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol, which is a promising future biofuel. The CoxP@POP exhibited superior catalytic activity and selectivity toward desired product with improved stability compared to the Co3O4@POP. Based on advanced sample characterization results, the extraordinary selectivity of CoxP@POP is attributed to the strong interaction of the cation of the CoxP nanoparticle with the POP matrix and the consequent modifications of the electronic states. Through attenuated total reflectance-infrared spectroscopy, we have also observed different interaction strengths between vanillin and the two catalysts. The decreased catalytic activity of Co3O4@POP compared to CoxP@POP catalyst could be attributed to the stronger adsorption of vanillin over the Co3O4@POP catalyst. Also from kinetic investigation, it is clearly demonstrated that the Co3O4@POP has higher activation energy barrier than the CoxP@POP, which also reflects to the reduction of the overall efficiency of the Co3O4@POP catalyst. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach in POP-encapsulated cobalt phosphide catalyst synthesis and comprehensive study in establishing the structure-activity relationship in significant step-forwarding in promoting biomass refining. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A process to produce both biodiesel and alginate in an integrated manner from a brown seaweed, Laminaria japonica, was established. Mannitol, a major carbon constituent in L. japonica, served to produce neutral lipids via the heterotrophic cultivation of an oleaginous yeast, Cryptococcus sp.; and simultaneously alginate, a high value product, was extracted to enhance the economic feasibility of the entire process. Only autoclave pretreatment, without need of any chemical agents, was enough to recover all the essential nutrients for the yeast cultivation. Specifically, it could recover 6.4 g L −1 of mannitol to a degree comparable to 6.6 g L −1 obtained by acid-aided pretreatment using 1.5% (v/v) of H 2 SO 4 . Maximum fatty acids methyl esters (FAME) content was 30.37% with FAME productivity of 0.56 g L −1 d −1 , and the produced FAME could meet the biodiesel quality standards. Na 2 CO 3 -based method showed the best efficiency of alginate recovery, yielding 21.06% (w/w). This study supports that L. japonica can indeed be a promising low-cost feedstock for biodiesel production, and it is more so when a high-value product alginate is co-produced. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper explores a case of reputation and stakeholder management in sustainability transitions. We use the case of aviation biofuel (biokerosene) to explore the complications around signalling in strategic niche management processes. Biokerosene is currently supplied at several Scandinavian airports in a low percentage blend, either as standard or upon request, although trials suggest that modern jet engines can reliably handle much higher percentage blends. Airlines, airports and biokerosene suppliers cooperate in a process of mutual strategic positioning that supports confidence-building and market development, while at the same time being intended to encourage positive stakeholder perceptions. A key challenge for the sector, however, is that signalling biokerosene as a response to aviation-related climate emissions is complicated by mixed societal perceptions of biofuel sustainability; and the policy and material conditions for affordable, sustainable, large scale supply of biofuel are lacking. Thus while parts of the sector would like to more clearly signal the value of existing and greater biokerosene use, interrelationships between reputational risks, supply constraints and economics limit this. By bringing stakeholder management theory to strategic niche management, we present a view of the latter as in part reputationally driven, in response to the uncertain legitimacy of a technology at an early stage in its market development. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Both value-added utilization of low-rank renewable feedstocks to prepare catalytic materials and selective transformation of bioderived aldehydes are very attractive topics. Herein, lignosulfonate, a waste by-product from the paper industry, was simply assembled with ZrCl4 under non-toxic hydrothermal conditions for scalable preparation of Zr-containing polyphenolic biopolymer catalysts (Zr–LS). Systematic characterizations indicated that the strong coordination between Zr4+ and phenolic hydroxyl groups in lignosulfonate led to the formation of strong Lewis acid-base couple sites (Zr4+−O2−) and porous inorganic-organic framework structure (mesopores centered at 6.1 nm), while the inherent sulfonic groups in lignosulphonate could serve as Brønsted acidic sites. The cooperative role of these versatile acid−base sites in Zr–LS afforded excellent catalytic performance for Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reaction of a broad range of bioderived platform chemicals under mild conditions (80 °C), especially of furfural (FF) to furfuryl alcohol (FA), in quantitative yields (96%) with high FA formation rate of 9600 μmol g−1 h−1 and TOF of 4.37 h−1. Kinetic studies revealed that the activation energy of the MPV reduction of FF was as low as 52.25 kJ/mol, accounting for the high reaction rate. Isotopic labelling experiments demonstrated direct hydrogen transfer from the α-C of 2-PrOH to the α-C of FF on acid-base sites was the rate-determining step. Moreover, Zr–LS showed good recyclability for at least seven reaction cycles. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Natural algal bloom consists of promising algal species which could be a feasible option for the source of bulk biomass and biodiesel production. It has been found in five natural fresh water algal blooms (Uttar Pradesh, India), containing high nitrogen (N) (4.6 ± 0.32 mg/L) and phosphorus (P) (4.12 ± 0.29 mg/L) concentration during spring (23.9–25.9 °C) and summer season (32.0–35.0 °C). Among the isolated algae from naturally occurring bloom, Chlorella sorokiniana MKP01 exhibited highest biomass (1.02 ± 0.02 g/L) and lipid content (174.1 ± 9.6 mg/L) in untreated tap water and urea/single super phosphate (SSP) in the ratio (2:1). The biodiesel quality was assessed and found to be with the Indian and international standards. Algal bloom was artificially developed in the open pond containing 10,000 l tap water supplemented with Urea/SSP (2:1) for a consistent supply of bulk biomass, yielded 8 kg of total biomass and lipid 1.3 kg. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In this present study, the compression ignition engine was designed to run on CIME (Calophyllum inophyllum methyl ester) biodiesel with nanoparticles. The TiO2 nanoparticle is added to the biodiesel in the form of nanofluid at concentration levels of 100 ppm whereas ethanox is added at levels of 100, 200 and 500 ppm. The nanoparticle and the ethanox are dispersed by the ultrasonication process. The addition of nanofluid reduces the particulate emission like nitrogen oxide (NOx) at 100% load. The efficiency is better and emission is reduced owing to the influence of explosion of water molecules present in the biodiesel. We found ethanox to be a superlative nanofluid to reduce the emission of toxic gas at appreciable levels. We have witnessed a 20% reduction in emission of NOx and 10% reduction of other particulate emission. In addition, the exit geometry of exhaust is modified from a circular shape to an elliptical one and the consequence of the geometry is calculated. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - An experiment was carried out to investigate the performance and exhaust emissions of a diesel engine using jojoba ethyl ester (JEE), and its blends with ethanol in different ratios of 5, 10, 15 and 20% ethanol (denoted by E5, E10, E15 and E20). Engine performance and exhaust emission of five different fuels in a single-cylinder, naturally aspirated, direct-injection diesel engine were compared with those of diesel fuel at different engine speeds from 1000 to 2000 rpm. The engine performance (power, torque, specific fuel consumption, and thermal efficiency) and exhaust emissions (CO2, CO, NOx, and SO2) were measured and are presented here. Details of the effects of the fuels on the combustion and exhaust emissions are discussed in the present work. JEE and its blends with ethanol are considered good biofuels, which can be used in diesel engines, with minimum modifications needed to the engine; however, efforts are still needed to reduce the viscosity of JEE. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This investigation is focused on the effect of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and injection timing on the performance, combustion and exhaust emission characteristics of common rail direct injection (CRDI) engine fueled with bioethanol-blended diesel using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. Simulation is carried out for various EGR rates (0, 10, 20 and 30%), two different injection timings, and two different bioethanol–diesel blends (10 and 20%) at injection pressure. The equivalence ratio is kept constant in all the cases of bioethanol–diesel blends. The results indicate that the mean CO formation and ignition delay increase, whereas mean NO formation and in-cylinder temperature decrease, with increase in the EGR rate. Further, with an increase in percentage of the bioethanol blends, CO and soot formation decrease as compared to neat diesel. A significant increase in in-cylinder pressure (15%) is found at 14° before top dead centre (BTDC) compared to 9° BTDC, which leads to an increase in indicated thermal efficiency of 4% for neat diesel at 30% EGR. In the present study, maximum indicated thermal efficiency is obtained in the case of 10 and 20% bioethanol–diesel blend, and remains constant for all EGR rates considered in the study. Obtained results are validated with the available literature data and indicate good agreement. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study examines the interfuel substitution effects of biofuel use on carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S. transportation sector. First, the dynamic linear logit model is used to examine substitution possibilities between biofuels and non-biofuels. The results reveal that petroleum demand is the most inelastic with respect to changes in petroleum prices since the transportation sector depends heavily on the use of petroleum. In addition, ethanol serves as a substitute for petroleum, showing that the use of ethanol can reduce the dependence on petroleum when petroleum prices increase. The results also indicate that ethanol is a complement for natural gas, while natural gas is a substitute for petroleum. Second, the coefficients for carbon dioxide emissions are used to compute the potential amount of carbon dioxide associated with interfuel substitution. The results represent that price-induced interfuel substitution is a critical factor to predict biofuel-related carbon dioxide emissions. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Refineries Residual Fuel Oil (RFO) and Bakelite (BL) and were co-pyrolyzed together using catalyst ZSM-5 under the atmospheric pressure with different mixing ratios of the feedstocks. The TGA analysis shows that most of the degradation take place between the temperature range of 250-400oC. The studies were carried out at two different temperatures of 500oC and 600oC using a batch reactor with different blended ratios, with blended feedstocks to catalyst ratio of 4:1. The effects of the two variables i.e. temperature and blending ratios among the two feedstocks, in terms of the products yield of liquid fuel, gas, coke and conversion were determined. The blending ratio of 4:1 (RFO: BL) yielding highest conversion of 76 wt. % at 600oC was found to be the most favourable condition in this investigation. © 2020 Phcogj.Com.

AB  - Nigeria, being the world's largest importer of diesel-powered gen-sets, is expected to invest in bio-fuels in the future. Hence, it is important to examine the thermal properties and synergy of wastes for potential downstream resource utilization. In this study, thermal conversion as a route to reduce the exploding volume of wastes from sachet-water plastic (SWP) and oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB) biomass was studied. Thermogravimetric (TGA) and subsequent differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) was used for the analysis. The effect of heating rate at 20 °C min-1 causes the increase of activation energy of the decomposition in the first-stage across all the blends (0.96 and 16.29 kJ mol-1). A similar phenomenon was seen when the heating rate was increased from 10 to 20 °C min-1 in the second-stage of decomposition. Overall, based on this study on the synergistic effects during the process, it can be deduced that co-pyrolysis can be an effective waste for energy platform. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Abstract: The use of nickel-based catalysts in the hydrodeoxygenation of vegetable oils is an alternative to employing systems based on noble metals and sulfided hydrotreatment catalysts. Modifying nickel hydrodeoxygenation catalysts with molybdenum and copper increases the yield of target reaction products and the resistance of catalytic systems to the effect of an aggressive medium. The aim of this work is to determine the dependence between the temperature, contact time, and activity of modified nickel-containing catalyst in the hydrodeoxygenation of esters of fatty carboxylic acids and determine the effective kinetic parameters for the consumption of the reagent. The experiments are performed in a continuous flow reactor with a fixed catalyst bed at $${{P}_{{{{{\text{H}}}_{2}}}}}$$ = 0.25 MPa, temperatures of 270, 285, 300, and 315°C, and a contact time varying from 600 to 1800 s. The results show the selectivity toward the main reaction products (nonane and decane) remains the same when either the temperature of experiment or the contact time are varied. Experimental data are used to determine the effective rate constant and energy of activation of ester consumption. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - Abstract: A study is made of the effect of the composition of the active component of copper-doped nickel catalysts on their activity and selectivity in the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of model compounds of vegetable oils (esters) to remove oxygen atoms from them with the formation of alkanes. It is shown that the Ni/Al2O3 and Ni–Cu/Al2O3 catalysts are active in this process. With them, the hydrodeoxygenation of methyl ester of hexadecanoic acid mixed with ethyl ester of decanoic acid results in the formation of С6−С16 alkanes and oxygen-containing products, while methane and ethane can be found in the gas phase. When the Ni : Cu ratio in the catalysts is lowered, the conversion of esters and the capability of these catalysts for C–C bond hydrogenolysis are reduced. This means the introduction of copper can promote retention of the carbon skeleton of alkanes obtained as a result of hydrodeoxygenation, along with the amount of methane. According to X-ray diffraction data, introducing copper into the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst results in the formation of Ni1 – xCux solid solutions. According to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data, lowering the content of copper in the Ni–Cu/Al2O3 catalyst raises the Ni : Cu ratio on a sample’s surface. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - The ever increasing utilization of energy has resulted in the nation becoming progressively more dependent on fossil fuels such as oil, coal and gas. The mounting prices of crude oil and natural gas and their impending paucity have raised qualms about the security of energy supply in future, which has severe consequence on the augmentation of a countries economy. The alternative to fossil fuels are the non-conventional energy sources, they are plentiful, renewable, pollution-free and eco-friendly. Therefore, the need to utilize renewable energy sources like solar energy, wind, tide, biodiesel has publicized its significance. Biodiesel is one of the unsurpassed resources that have come to the cutting edge recently. In this article, highly rated research journals on biofuels were referred and a detailed assessment has been conducted to emphasize different aspects to biodiesel engineering. These aspects include biodiesel feed stocks, a range of various methods used in production of biodiesel such as pyrolysis, micro emulsion, dilution and transesterification (alcoholysis). The study was extended to understand the effect of biodiesel blend magnitude on the performance of engine parameters such as brake power (BP), brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and fuel properties like cloud point, flash point, calorific value, kinematic viscosity, density, and cetane number as well as the economic viability, emission characteristics and finally Greenhouse gas emissions. © BEIESP.

AB  - To elucidate the characteristics of fine particulate matter pollutant emitted from a diesel engine, a fossil-based diesel fuel (D100) and two blended fuels consisting of D100 and waste cooking oil (WCO) convered biodiesel (W) are tested with a diesel engine generator at loads of 1.5 kW and 3.0 kW. The blended fuels contain 20% and 40% W and are referred to as W20 and W40, respectively. The PM2.5 emissions and their polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and metallic components are investigated. Experimental results show that higher concentrations of PM2.5, PM2.5-bound ΣPAHs and Σmetals, and ΣBaPeq are generated at the 3.0 kW load, with its greater fuel consumption (FC), than the 1.5 kW load. Additionally, of the three fuels, using W20 emits the lowest concentrations of PM2.5, PM2.5-bound ΣPAHs, and ΣBaPeq. Specifically, the reduction in ΣBaPeq mainly results from the effective inhibition of HMW-BaPeq. Conversely, when using W40, the PM2.5-bound Σmetals significantly decreases, and its composition is strongly affected by the metallic content in the fuel. Although W20 and W40 exhibit higher FC (3.0% more) and brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC; 3.1% more) than D100, they generate lower concentrations of PM2.5 (18.1% less), PM2.5-bound ΣPAHs (22.8% less) and Σmetals (22.0% less), and ΣBaPeq (35.0% less) at both engine loads. The emission factors of these pollutants in the engine exhaust are also reduced, particularly at the higher load (3.0 kW). Accordingly, WCO-based biodiesel additives may decrease the PM2.5, PAHs, and metals exhausted by diesel engines, thus reducing the BaPeq of these emissions. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.

AB  - The rising demand and cost of fossil fuels (diesel and gasoline), together with the need for sustainable, alternative, and renewable energy sources have increased the interest for biomass-based fuels such as biodiesel. Among renewable sources of biofuels, biodiesel is particularly attractive as it can be used in conventional diesel engines without any modification. Oleaginous yeasts are excellent oil producers that can grow easily on various types of hydrophilic and hydrophobic waste streams that are used as feedstock for single cell oils and subsequently biodiesel production. In this study, cultivation of Rhodosporidium kratochvilovae on a hydrophobic waste (clarified butter sediment waste medium (CBM)) resulted in considerably high lipid accumulation (70.74% w/w). Maximum cell dry weight and total lipid production were 15.52 g/L and 10.98 g/L, respectively, following cultivation in CBM for 144 h. Neutral lipids were found to accumulate in the lipid bodies of cells, as visualized by BODIPY staining and fluorescence microscopy. Cells grown in CBM showed large and dispersed lipid droplets in the intracellular compartment. The fatty acid profile of biodiesel obtained after transesterification was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS), while its quality was determined to comply with ASTM 6751 and EN 14214 international standards. Hence, clarified sediment waste can be exploited as a cost-effective renewable feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This study investigated the acid-catalyzed esterification of two brands of crude rice bran oil (CRBO) with free fatty acids (FFAs) content of about 8 and 10%, respectively. Experimental variables included reaction time, methanol-to-FFA molar ratio and sulfuric acid content with temperature and stirring speed fixed at 60 °C and 600 RPM, respectively. A central composite design was used initially for sequential experimentation and followed by a Box-Behnken design to refine the optimum process conditions. Results showed that final FFA in CRBO could be reduced to less than 1% FFA in a single-step. The methanol-to-FFA molar ratio had the maximum influence on the esterification process and was followed by the reaction time and amount of catalyst. The optimum conditions for FFA conversion in CRBO were: reaction time 90 and 48 min, 62:1 and 70:1 methanol-to-FFA molar ratio, 22.5 and 20% (w/w) sulfuric acid based on FFA for Brand I and II, respectively. Under these pretreatment conditions, initial FFA was reduced to 0.61 and 0.70%, respectively making the CRBO suitable for biodiesel production. © 2019, Faculty of Environment and Resource Studies,Mahidol University.

AB  - International air transport is one of the fast-growing sources of CO2 emissions. However, it has always been omitted from the international emission mitigation pledges. The delayed mitigation process in this area may slow down the process of global CO2 emission control. In this article, we evaluated the potential to realize the emission mitigation targets in air transport through biofuel and estimated the corresponding cost. The emission from international air transport of Palau and Seychelles was taken as the example. Then, the emission caused by each airline to these two islands was calculated by the distance-based method, with information of the travelers' arrival data, fuel consumption of different aircraft types, routes, and aircraft seat data. Future scenarios with and without commitment to CO2 mitigation targets were predicted to evaluate the emission difference. Then, we estimated the amount of biofuel required to fill the emission gap, and the corresponding cost based on the future biofuel price prediction. The results show that distance is the determining factor of international air transport emission per capita. The component of origin can decrease the aggregated emission per capita to small island destinations by 0.5-2%. The accumulated emission gaps are 3.15 Mt and 9 Mt for Palau and Seychelles, which indicates that 7.64 and 19.34 Mb of biofuel are needed for emission mitigation, respectively. The corresponding costs are $27-163 million and $72-424 million per year. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Biorefineries intends to utilize algal biomass and their by-products at industrial scale. The macroalgae Kappa-phycus alvarezii has high content of carrageenan, which is a polysaccharide hydrocolloid, serving as a raw material for the production of third generation biofuels, food and pharma-ceuticals. The aim of this study is to show that besides these products, there is the potential for the production of a fourth generation biofuel. Two strains, brown and red, were selected based on their high growth rates and productivity and were treated with 6% KOH for extraction carrageenan extraction. The results of the chemical composition of this residue show that there is considerable amount of fermentable sugar in the carrageenan extraction residue. The glucan conversion was 100% for both strains, and the concentrations of glucose from the brown and red strains were 13.7 and 11.5 g L−1, respectively. The results highlight the efficiency of generating a key bioproduct from carrageenan residue. This would save the carrageenan that can be used for as a food thickener as it has been used for centuries. Thus, the biorefinery of K. alvarezii can be exploited not only to produce carrageenan, but also to generate glucose for future use in biofuel production. © 2019, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

AB  - The world is concerned with the degradation of the Saharan eco-system due to the absence of green spaces, emission of greenhouse gases and the burial of oases by sand beside the global energy crisis. This promoted the Algerian government to set a national strategy towards the use of renewable sources to cover 40% of its energy needs by 2030. In this article, a modern technique to simultaneously protect the environment and produce biofuels from the Saharan environment through cultivation of Moringa oleifera and valorizations of waste Phoenix dactylifera L. dates which are of not of satisfactory quality for the local market has been adopted. Characterization of Moringa oleifera oil, Moringa oleifera biodiesel and bioethanol produced from the waste date was done. Biodiesel-diesel-bioethanol blends were characterized by DSC, FT-IR, TGA and GC methods. Results show high oil content of Moringa oleifera seeds of 40%, biodiesel yield of 91% and bioethanol percentage of 96.83% with 3.17% of impurities. The properties of ternary blends of D80B5BE15, D80B10BE10 and D80B15BE5 exhibit similar densities and cold flow properties to Euro-diesel. Our analysis also proved that waste Phoenix dactylifera L. dates are useless as ruminant feed due to low protein content. In conclusion, the study proved the feasibility of cultivating Moringa oleifera to protect the environment and valorizing its seeds besides waste date seeds to produce both biodiesel and bioethanol in the Algerian Saharan. © 2019

AB  - This paper presents a beneficial combination of biomass gasification and pyrolysis oil hydrodeoxygenation for advanced biofuel production. Hydrogen for hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of liquid phase pyrolysis oil (LPP oil) was generated by gasification of softwood. The process merges dual fluidized bed (DFB) steam gasification, which produces a hydrogen rich product gas and the HDO of LPP oil. Synthesis gas was used directly without further cleaning and upgrading, by making use of the water gas-shift (WGS) reaction. The water needed for the water gas-shift reaction was provided by LPP oil. HDO was successfully performed in a lab scale over 36 h time on stream (TOS). Competing reactions like the Boudouard reaction and Sabatier reaction were not observed. Product quality was close to Diesel fuel specification according to EN 590, with a carbon content of 85.4 w% and a residual water content of 0.28 w%. The water-gas shift reaction was confirmed by CO/CO2-balance, high water consumption and 28% less hydrogen consumption during HDO. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - In the present study, the noise pollution from different compositions of biodiesel, bioethanol, and diesel fuels in a four-cylinder and four-stroke engine of MF285 tractor was studied. Further, the noise pollution was measured from two positions, the driver and bystander, at 1000, 1600, and 2000 revolutions, and ten different fuel levels resulting from different compositions of biodiesel, bioethanol, and diesel fuels. For data analysis, adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), artificial neural network (ANN), and response surface methodology (RSM) were applied. Comparing the means of noise pollution at different levels demonstrated that the B25E6D69 fuel, made up of 25% biodiesel and 6% bioethanol, had the lowest noise pollution. The lowest noise pollution was at 1000 rpm, and with the increase of engine speed, the noise pollution intensified. The models laid by the RSM were better than other. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Growing demand for biomass-derived fuels has resulted in an increase in bioenergy projects in recent years, a trend that is expected to continue. However, broad expansion of bioenergy feedstock production may have significant environmental consequences. Accordingly, the goal of this study is to investigate how forest-based bioenergy development may affect hydrological systems at the watershed scale. Specifically, this study addresses hybrid poplar cultivation for biofuel production in a snow-dominated watershed in northern Wisconsin, USA. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), calibrated and validated for streamflow and biomass production cycles, is used to evaluate the effects of land use change corresponding to a range of biofuel development scenarios. The biofuel scenarios follow physically-based rules for land use conversion to poplar plantations from hay, pasture, and forested lands; along with a suite of alternative management practices, including rotation time, planting density, fertilizer application and irrigation. Trade-offs between biomass production, fertilizer use, and hydrologic alteration are evaluated for the feedstock production system. The highest density (1111 trees/100 m2) and shortest rotation (5-year) treatments produce the highest biomass and are the most efficient treatments in terms of water and fertilizer use per ton of biomass. The high efficiency is due to optimal relationships between leaf area index, biomass production, and N uptake. At annual or greater time scales, the simulated conversion to poplar had minimal effect on ET and streamflows. However, in summer months, the ET from the poplar substantially exceeds that of the original land use, so that streamflows decrease by as much as 50%. Irrigation to meet soil water deficits increased biomass production, but only by 4% on average, which is not surprising for a temperate, humid watershed. © 2019

AB  - In the current phase of world economy, the utilization of the petroleum-based fossil fuels has drastically surpassed the supply. This scenario supplements to the fact that there is an ever increasing necessity for industrialization, specifically in the transportation sector. This requirement and supply of the petroleum and diesel fuels have an astounding impact over the market economy and related commodities. Low viscous and low cetane number biofuels are getting more attention for their usage in engine applications without any further processing. In the present work, lemon peel oil is being fuelled in diesel engine at different timing of injection and exhaust gas recirculation rates. Operation of lemon peel oil (LPO) at standard operating conditions results in increased brake thermal efficiency by consuming less fuel when compared with diesel fuel. The LPO biofuel properties such as boiling point and viscosity being lower leads to better evaporation capacity and thereby results in complete combustion. The advancement in injection timing of 25° bTDC and 27° bTDC resulted in the efficiency increment of 2.17% and 6.19% respectively. Furthermore, the smoke, carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions are decreased in consequence on increased nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. Hence, in order to decrease the content of nitrogen oxide emissions in the exhaust, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) has been implemented in the present work. For EGR rate of 10% and 20%, the NOx emissions is reduced by 43% and 46% respectively for 27° bTDC injection timing. Thus, the advancement of injection timing with optimum EGR is a viable option for the lemon peel oil biofuel in diesel engine with superior performance and emission output. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The present study is an assessment of using Turel Kongreng (river mussels) as a source of heterogenous catalyst in biodiesel production. After the calcination is performed at 800 °C for 1 h, the calcinated samples were subjected to characterization techniques such as X-ray dispersive analysis, Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy, Scanning electron microscopy and Energy dispersive x-ray analysis. The characterizations showed excellent formation of calcium oxide (CaO) and the same is compared with CaO synthesized from other sources. A confirmation test using the newly synthesized CaO is conducted using waste cooking oil with catalyst loading of 10% (wt.%), alcohol to oil ratio of 10:1, reaction temperature of 75 °C and a reaction time of 60 mins. The study showed a conversion rate of 91.04%, which is well within the high conversion band among all other catalyst materials. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this study is to evaluate economic support measures based on current EU policies affecting the profitability of large-scale deployment of biochar for sunflower cultivation in dry marginal lands in Italy, paving the way to large scale carbon sequestration in the EU Mediterranean region. Two cases were considered: i) straight biochar use and ii) biochar in combination with compost (COMBI: 20% biochar and 80% compost mass fraction), at application rates of 5 and 10 Mg ha−1 respectively. Based on realistic estimations of achievable crop-yield performances by biochar and COMBI addition to dry soils, the effect of current policies on the economic viability of biochar deployment and farmers’ income has been investigated. Using a cost-model we identified the required levels of support, in the form of (i) area subsidies for crop cultivation, (ii) tradable carbon certificates (credits), and (iii) REDII-compliant biofuel support for Aviation and Maritime, so to make biochar and sunflower cultivation in EU MED dry marginal lands competitive for sustainable crop-based biofuels. Results show that, by employing existing policy instruments, sufficient income can be generated for famers to recover marginal land, sequester large amount of carbon by BECCS at costs (∼82 € Mg−1 of CO2) falling at or below the typical range of CCS measures, as well as offer additional environmental and socio-economic positive benefits. The combination of currently operational economic mechanisms from the Common Agricultural Policy, the Climate Policy, and the Renewable Energy Directive II can: i) maintain domestic farming activities, ii) support the implementation of biochar projects at local level, iii) contribute to achieve EU and national biofuel targets without generating ILUC impacts and iv) achieve unprecedent potential for carbon sequestration. However, prior to large-scale deployment, targeted on-site R&amp;D actions aimed at validating biochar effects under local conditions (soil, climate, crops) are recommended, together with training and capacity building activities for local farmers. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - The effects of iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), and molybdenum (Mo) on the biomass yield, lipid content, lipid yield, and fatty acid composition of Chlorella sp. NC-MKM, Graesiella emersonii NC-M1, Scenedesmus acutus NC-M2, and Chlorophyta sp. NC-M5 were studied. Among them, G. emersonii NC-M1 recorded the highest percentage increase in lipid content (140.3%) and neutral lipid (50.9%) under Zn-supplemented condition compared to the control. Also, it showed a 105% and 41.88% increase in lipid yield and neutral lipid under Fe-supplemented condition compared to the control. However, Chlorella sp. NC-MKM recorded an elevation in lipid yield (70.3% rise) and neutral lipid (24.32% rise) compared to the control in Mo-supplemented condition. The enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant enzyme (SOD and POD) under Fe-, Zn-, and Mo-supplemented condition supports the lipid accumulation. FAME analysis showed that the overall percentage of SFA and MUFA increased after the addition of Fe, Zn, and Mo in a culture medium compared to the control which is vital for a good-quality biodiesel. Further, biodiesel properties derived from FAMEs such as CN, SV, IV, CFPP, OS, υ, ρ, and HHV were found in accordance with biodiesel standard. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Biofuel, as a renewable energy, has gained much attention due to the threat of exhaustion of fossil sources and the enormous pressure of environmental pollution. However, biofuels often suffer from low densities and high volatilities, which limit their application in important liquid transportation fuels, for example, jet and diesel fuels. At present, the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass-derived chemicals has become a promising approach to produce high-density jet and diesel biofuels. Herein a rapid, green Michael addition reaction is developed for constructing intermediates of a series of new high-density biofuels with volumetric neat heat of combustion (VNHOC) values. The reactions are performed under solvent-free conditions with commercially cheap tetrabutylammonium bromide (0.05 eq) and K3PO4·3H2O (0.03 eq) as a catalyst and a base, respectively, to afford products with good to excellent yields of 89%–99%. The theoretical calculation indicates that the VNHOC values of the potential biofuels (up to 39.06 MJ L−1) are comparable to those of most state-of-the-art biofuels and commercial jet fuels that are obtained from fossil sources. This method may pave a new way of investigating high-density biofuels with accurate structures and high-energy contents. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - The spray combustion characteristics of sunflower (Helianthus annuus) biodiesel/methyl esters (SFME) and 50% SFME/diesel blend and diesel were investigated via a liquid swirl flame burner. The swirl flame was established at atmospheric condition by using a combined twin-fluid atomiser-swirler configuration at varied atomising air-to-liquid ratios (ALR) of 2.0–2.5. Diesel flame showed a sooty flame brush downstream of the main reaction zone, as opposed to the biodiesel flame which showed a non-sooty, bluish flame core. Biodiesel flame exhibited a more intense flame spectra with higher OH* radicals as compared to diesel. Higher preheating main swirl air temperature led to higher NO emission, while CO correspondingly decreased. Sunflower-derived biodiesel generally exhibited slightly higher NO and CO levels than diesel when compared at the same power output, mostly due to higher flame temperature and fuel chemistry effect. By increasing ALR, a significant reduction of NO and CO for both fuel types were concurrently achieved, presenting a strategy to control emissions and atomise biodiesel with higher viscosity under swirl combustion mode. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Limited fossil fuel reserves led to focus on alternatives fuels for combustion engines. Several studies reported optimal (20%)biodiesel blend for utility in compression ignition engine at constant compression ratio. Literature lacks on the study of palm-based biodiesel in blended form at varying engine compression ratios. In this study, an initiative was undertaken to study the effect of variable compression ratio (16:1, 17:1 and 18:1)on various engine characteristics by fuelling 20% palm biodiesel blending compression ignition engine. The ignition delay period decreased, whereas the peak cylinder pressure and brake thermal efficiency increased with increase in the engine compression ratio from 16:1 to 18:1. At 3.5 bar bmep, brake thermal efficiency values were observed to be 28.9, 30.8 and 33.8% at 16:1, 17:1 and 18:1 CRs, respectively in B20 fuel. Moreover, increasing compression ratio from 16:1 to 18:1, the average reduction in emissions of hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide and smoke opacity were observed to be 47.8, 41.0 and 35.7%, respectively whereas, oxides of nitrogen emissions increased by 41.1%. Thus, it is inferred that B20 fuel performed well at high engine compression ratio. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper uses a confidential refinery-level dataset to estimate how unexpected changes in the costs of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) affected US oil refinery prices and production decisions for regulated and non-regulated products between 2012 and 2014. The RFS mandates blending of biofuels with conventional gasoline and diesel. Each gallon of biofuel blended with conventional fuel generates a renewable fuel credit (RIN). Refineries comply with the RFS by purchasing RINs from blenders and retiring them with the EPA. I find that RIN costs were fully passed through to wholesale gasoline and diesel prices on average, consistent with previous literature and a necessary condition to ensure the effectiveness of the RFS. Furthermore, I estimate full pass-through in all regions of the US, with the exception of the Eastern Seaboard. I also find that RIN cost increases are associated with higher jet fuel production, a non-regulated product, and with decreased jet fuel prices. Finally, I corroborate previous findings by showing that refinery specific input cost shocks are not fully passed-through to wholesale output prices. These results, combined with other estimates in the literature, suggest that on average the RFS is functioning efficiently and that the wholesale petroleum market is highly competitive. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuel is an important alternative to the limited resources of fossil fuels for use in power generation. Currently, regular alcohol is used as a feedstock; however, it is known to be toxic. Hence, in this paper, we demonstrate that anhydrous alcohol obtained from palm wine is a potential alternative as the main feedstock for biofuel production. In this study, the aim was to improve the anhydrous alcohol obtained from palm wine based on storage conditions. Although this type of anhydrous alcohol has been previously produced, it is demonstrated that the current method is more efficient than the previous one. The processes implemented in this study were fractionation and extractive distillation. Two numerical simulations were carried out using extractive distillation processes to evaluate of an ethanol and water mixture, that is, ethylene glycol or glyceride. The palm wine was characterized based on the determination of the alcohol content, pH, acidity and the content of free SO 2 . The alcohol produced was characterized through the determination of its concentration, viscosity and density and infrared spectroscopy analysis. The results illustrate that it is possible to obtain excellent quality anhydrous alcohol suitable for small biofuel production, which is increasingly in demand in rural villages in Sub-Saharan Africa. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - The present study aim is to characterise catalytic and non-catalytic biomass pyrolysis liquid products. Turkey is the world’s largest hazelnut producer and also ranks fifth in tea production, so a mixture of hazelnut shell, tea bush and hazelnut knot was selected as the biomass sample, and vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) was also used as a catalyst. Considering the biomass mixture and catalyst used, this research is unique for the literature. Bio-oils, which are obtained by catalytic and non-catalytic processes and collected in two sub-fractions, were characterised. The sub-fractions of toluene and ethyl acetate, there was a significant increase in calorific values compared with the mixture without catalyst, because of the decrease in the amount of oxygen and increase in the amount of carbon. The increase in this calorific value in the toluene sub-fraction is about 76% higher than the raw material mixture. In the sub-fractions of toluene and ethyl acetate produced by catalytic pyrolysis, an increase in carbon content was observed when compared with non-catalytic products, while the amounts of oxygen decreased. Considering the results, the toluene sub-fraction is generally composed of phenolic structures. Generally, the ethyl acetate sub-fraction comprises the carbonyl group – containing ketone and aldehyde structures as well as aromatic and phenolic compounds. The resulting bio-oil has the potential to be used as a liquid fuel both in terms of calorific values and in terms of the H/C and O/C ratio. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Biomass feedstock can be used for the production of biofuels or biobased chemicals to reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Earlier studies about the techno-economic performance of biofuel or biobased chemical production varied in biomass feedstock, conversion process, and other techno-economic assumptions. This made a fair comparison between different industrial processing pathways difficult. The aim of this study is to quantify uniformly the factory-gate production costs and the GHG emission intensity of biobased ethanol, ethylene, 1,3-propanediol (PDO), and succinic acid, and to compare them with each other and their respective fossil equivalent products. Brazilian sugarcane and eucalyptus are used as biomass feedstock in this study. A uniform approach is applied to determine the production costs and GHG emission intensity of biobased products, taking into account feedstock supply, biobased product yield, capital investment, energy, labor, maintenance, and processing inputs. Economic performance and net avoided GHG emissions of biobased chemicals depend on various uncertain factors, so this study pays particular attention to uncertainty by means of a Monte Carlo analysis. A sensitivity analysis is also performed. As there is uncertainty associated with the parameters used for biobased product yield, feedstock cost, fixed capital investment, industrial scale, and energy costs, the results are presented in ranges. The 60% confidence interval ranges of the biobased product production costs are 0.64–1.10 US$ kg−1 ethanol, 1.18–2.05 US$ kg−1 ethylene, 1.37–2.40 US$ kg−1 1,3-PDO, and 1.91–2.57 US$ kg−1 succinic acid. The cost ranges of all biobased products partly or completely overlap with the ranges of the production costs of the fossil equivalent products. The results show that sugarcane-based 1,3-PDO and to a lesser extent succinic acid have the highest potential benefit. The ranges of GHG emission reduction are 1.29–2.16, 3.37–4.12, 2.54–5.91, and 0.47–5.22 CO2eq kg−1 biobased product for ethanol, ethylene, 1,3-PDO, and succinic acid respectively. Considering the potential GHG emission reduction and profit per hectare, the pathways using sugarcane score are generally better than eucalyptus feedstock due to the high yield of sugarcane in Brazil. Overall, it was not possible to choose a clear winner, (a) because the best performing biobased product strongly depends on the chosen metric, and (b) because of the large ranges found, especially for PDO and succinic acid, independent of the chosen metric. To quantify the performance better, more data are required regarding the biobased product yield, equipment costs, and energy consumption of biobased industrial pathways, but also about the production costs and GHG emission intensity of fossil-equivalent products. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Microalgae are potential candidates for the production of third-generation biofuels, but the high-energy consumption of harvesting biomass makes current commercial microalgal biodiesel production economically unfeasible. Self-flocculation is regarded as a cost-efficient strategy for harvesting microalgae. In this work, a coculture system was developed by the mixotrophic cultivation of two poorly flocculating microalgae, Desmodesmus sp. ZFY and Monoraphidium sp. QLY-1, for self-flocculation of microalgal cells. The flocculation efficiency for harvesting was enhanced to 85.33% with settling for 4 h in coculture, which was better than that in mono-culture (57.98% and 32.45%). Coculture resulted in changes in both the concentration and composition of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS)in the culture, which partially contributed to cell aggregation. The concentration of polysaccharides in LB-EPS ranged from 27.01% and 27.35% in mono-culture to 46.53% in coculture. Moreover, the fine properties of lipid productivity (93.99 mg L −1 d −1 )and fatty acid composition in coculture indicated the potential to produce biodiesel within most biodiesel standards. © 2019 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - The share of biofuels in the fuel market has increased over the last several decades. This is related to their potential to reduce the emissions including particulate matter. It has been frequently reported that the fuel oxygen content is the main reason for the reduction in particulate matter emissions. To understand the effect of fuel oxygen content on morphology and nanostructure characteristics of soot particles, different fuels such as diesel, coconut biodiesel and triacetin were tested in a diesel engine with various mixing proportions. The fuel blending was done in such a way that overall oxygen content of fuel was kept in range of 0% to 14% (wt.%). The soot particles were sampled from the engine exhaust system and analysed with a transmission electron microscope (TEM) at low and high spatial resolution. The TEM images were post-processed with the help of an in-house developed image analysis program to determine the morphology and nanostructure characteristics. The results show that oxygenated fuel blends emit smaller sized soot particles forming compact aggregates. The investigation of the internal structure of soot particles show disordered arrangement of graphene layers for fuels up to 11.01% fuel oxygen content (pure biodiesel); however, the opposite trend was observed for fuel blends with triacetin which could be related to the presence of oxygen in a different chemical functional group. © 2019 The Combustion Institute

AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative energy source to replace fossil fuels and reduce the environmental pollution. Adding biodiesel in fossil diesel can increase the oxygen content (from fatty acid) and promote fuel to be burned more quickly and thoroughly. However, the biodiesel content criterion of different countries was diverse from each other. In this study, Raman spectroscopy was used as a tool in classifying fuel blends and quantifying biodiesel contents. For classifying the fuel blends, principal component analysis (PCA) method was employed, where 87.22% of spectral variation was characterized by the first two components PCA scores shows a clear discrimination between the pure fuels and mixture fuels. Meanwhile, for identifying and quantifying the blends of diesel and biodiesel, Raman spectroscopy analysis based on partial least squares (PLS) regression was conducted. Biodiesel mainly present three characteristic Raman regions corresponding to the spectroscopy of diesel. The C─H Raman region presents the better quantitative capacity than the C═C and C═O spectral regions. And the PLS regression built from C─H Raman spectral region in quantifying biodiesel contents presents a higher correlation coefficient and lower root mean square error for prediction. Furthermore, employing only C─H Raman region coupled with PLS regression for predicting concentration of biodiesel can reduce an order of magnitude of root mean square error compared with using three characteristic Raman spectral regions together. Our result show that Raman spectroscopy combined with PCA and PLS can identify fuels and biofuels for discrimination and quantitation. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The objective was to evaluate the effect of reusing Zarrouk's medium on a Spirulina sp. LEB 18 culture by determining kinetic parameters, chemical composition, biofuels, and thermal characterization. Cultivation was performed in a raceway bioreactor for 7 days, the supernatant was reused for four cycles. Culturing the microalga in the reused medium resulted in a cellular yield of 2.30 g L−1 (control) and 2.04, 1.89, 1.73, and 1.15 g L−1 for four cycles with no influence on cell growth and productivity. Biomass with high contents of carbohydrates (58.00%, 3rd cycle), phycocyanin (2.47 mg mL−1, 1st cycle), and saturated fatty acids (60.13%, 4th cycle) were obtained with an increase in the profiles of C16:0 (45.85%) and C18:2n6 (47.40%) in the 1st cycle. The reuse of Zarrouk's medium allowed obtaining biomass with reduced cost and differentiated characteristics, allowing the exploration of commercially important biomolecules by the completion of up to four cycles. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The denitrification of bio-oil remains an important challenge in bio-oil quality upgrading. Microalgae (MA) and sweet potato waste (SPW) were co-liquefied to investigate the denitrification of Mannich reaction. The influence of interaction reaction between MA and SPW on products qualities was explored. The results showed that the N contents of bio-oils from co-liquefaction (4.44–7.19%) were lower than that from microalgae (7.60%). Besides, the ester contents from MA&SPW (60.31–73.17%) were higher than that from MA (56.11%) and SPW (17.55%).The addition of SPW decreased the lubricating oil and fuel oil content. The experimental energy recovery efficiency (66.82–70.16%) was higher than the calculated energy recovery efficiency (65.68–66.69%) during co-liquefaction processes. Based on chemical compositions of products, a possible reaction pathway of Mannich reaction during co-liquefaction process was proposed. The current study suggested that co-liquefaction of microalgae and sweet potato waste was a feasibility way to improve the bio-oil quality and energy recovery efficiency. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, a conceptual process design of wastewater-based algal biofuels production through hydrothermal liquefaction and hydroprocessing is proposed. Then a steady-state process simulation is performed to calculate the mass and energy analysis of the whole process for the production of hydrocarbons such as diesel, jet, gasoline, and H2. A discounted cash flow analysis is used to calculate a minimum selling price (MSP) of the hydrocarbon fuels. The MSP of the hydrocarbon fuels is found at US$4.3/GGE. This value is comparable with the previously reported value in the literature. In addition, the sensitivity study is carried out to study the influence of both processes and economic parameters on the minimum selling price (MSP) of the hydrocarbon fuels. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In recent years, following the amendment to the European renewable energy directive (RED), there is an increasing interest to exploit Crude Tall Oil (CTO) for energetic purposes. This study conducted an integrated assessment to quantify the environmental, economic and social impact of these two competing material and energetic routes that consume CTO as a feedstock. The integrated assessment follows a cradle-to-grave approach to compare the impact on climate change from the production of bio-chemicals to that generated from the production of renewable diesel from CTO. In addition, the economic and social impact assessment estimates the total economic added value as well as the total number of direct, indirect and induced jobs generated by the two respective routes utilising CTO. The environmental assessment showed that the application of CTO for bio-chemicals has 23% lower greenhouse gas emissions than its application for renewable diesel. The economic assessment showed that the European pine chemicals industry generated at least 4 times higher added value than that generated from renewable diesel. Finally, when analysing the social impact, the utilisation of 650,000 of CTO to produce bio-chemicals generated around 9100 jobs. On the other hand, the renewable diesel production route was estimated to generate only 400 jobs. Therefore, the integrated assessment concludes that, diverting and utilising CTO to produce biofuels does not present a sustainable case when compared to its established use in the production of bio-chemicals. © 2019

AB  - In this work, a computer-aided molecular design based technique has been developed to upgrade bio-oil properties via solvent addition by targeting both functionality and sustainability targets. The direct application of bio-oils as a fuel is often constrained by their inferior properties such as high water content, high viscosity, low heating values, low miscibility, and storage instability as compared to conventional fuels. One promising method to upgrade bio-oil is the use of solvents as additives to generate a solvent–oil blend capable of meeting both its fuel functionality and sustainability targets in health, safety, and environmental aspects from production to point of application. Suitable solvents were formulated using computer-aided molecular design (CAMD) techniques by solving a two-stage multi-objective optimisation problem based on the defined targets. In the first stage, an optimisation model for solvent–oil blend functionality was constructed to optimise solvent functionality. In the second stage, a fuzzy optimisation approach aimed to optimise environmental, health, and safety (EHS) aspects via an index-based method. By implementing a max–min aggregation approach, an optimised solution has been generated by determining trade-off points that allowed significant EHS improvements at minimal expense of blend functionality. Lastly, the optimal solvent–oil blend was evaluated against conventional diesel in terms of carbon savings. This allowed the quantification of environmental savings through utilising biofuels while ensuring minimal compromise on fuel performance. Altogether, this approach has enabled the identification of feasible solvents for bio-oil upgrade and design of blends for application while allowing multi-objective optimisation of EHS targets. © 2019 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Excessive food waste presents an opportunity to simultaneously alleviate waste and produce renewable resources. The present work uses hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) with elevated temperatures (280–380 °C) and times (10–60 min) to convert categorized food residues collected from a university campus dining hall into biocrude oil. Analysis of distinct feedstocks presented different biochemical compositions (protein, carbohydrate, and lipid) and yielded between 2 and 79% biocrude oil for the respective optimized HTL temperatures and times. Reaction pathways and elemental distributions (C,H,N) elucidated HTL product qualities based on feedstocks and optimized reaction conditions. Both descriptive HTL process energy recoveries and consumption ratios are included. An improved predictive model was able to accurately determine biocrude oil yield (R2adj 98.3%) of different food wastes under different reaction conditions, as well as predict previously published data (R2 94.3%). Combined experimental and analytical results were used to assess the sustainability and robustness of the HTL process. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The revised Renewable Fuel Standard's cellulosic biofuels mandate requires the USA to consume 16 000 million gallons of cellulosic biofuel per year by 2022. The cellulosic biofuels industry has fallen far short of reaching the production targets needed to achieve this volume, and it has even struggled to achieve the greatly reduced revised volumes that were created by the US Environmental Protection Agency despite the subsequent inclusion of landfill gas within the mandate. This article examines the underlying causes of this shortfall from the perspectives of markets and policy. It examines how the cellulosic biofuels production environment has not been conducive to the cost-competitiveness of pioneer, first-of-their-kind facilities and pathway buildout, and how recent techno-economic analyses have used uncertainty to quantify the impacts of this environment. It further examines how the cellulosic biofuels mandate has actually hindered commercialization despite being intended to support it. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - Outdoor high cell-density microalgae cultivation is highly challenging due to unavailability of appropriate CO2 feeding strategy under diurnal sunlight intensities. Hence, a novel real time light based CO2 feeding strategy was firstly developed under diurnal simulated sunlight (LED) to test on Chlorella sp. in a 10 L scale bubble column photobioreactor. The strategy yielded a biomass titer of 5.12 g L−1 under simulated sunlight, far higher than existing biomass-density and pH-control based CO2 feeding strategies. In outdoor culturing, the proposed feeding strategy yielded high biomass titers of 6.8 and 9.0 g L−1 in growth-phase of two-stage and single-stage lipid induction studies respectively with same biomass productivity of 0.8 g L−1 day−1. Subsequently, two-stage lipid induction strategy of 6.8 g L−1 titer yielded biodiesel productivity of 120 g L−1 day−1, whereas single-stage strategy of 9.0 g L−1 titer was unable to induce lipid. Moreover, specific light availability affects the lipid production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study Scenedesmus abundans was used as a biosorbent material for removing hydrocarbons from simulated petroleum wastewater. Batch experiments resulted in the removal of 92.16% of hydrocarbons from simulated wastewater within 60 min. The spent biosorbent was converted to bio-oil through hydrothermal liquefaction process (HTL) at temperature range from 220 to 320 °C with 1 h holding time. Liquid hydrocarbons (bio-oil) yield was 43.4 wt% at 300 °C with 15 g of spent sorbent loading and possessed HHV of 39.10 MJ/Kg. Additionally the HTL wastewater (aqueous phase) was recycled as reaction medium and studied for its effects on bio-oil yield which increased till second cycle (47.91 wt%). HTL bio-char was employed as adsorbent to remove heavy metals from wastewater. It showed greater removal efficiency of 86.5% to Ni(II) ions. From the results it was concluded that the petroleum residues can be effectively recycled back into liquid hydrocarbons with simple waste management pathway. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The increasing use of biofuels in recent years has resulted in renewed consideration of compression ignition (CI) engines for power generation. However, the differences in chemical properties of these fuels have led to some variation in key engine performance parameters. Accordingly, researchers have begun to investigate the use of vibrationbased approaches in assessing these behaviors. Despite some progress in assessing the use of diesel in CI engines, very little has been done on assessing the use of fuel blends. The current work, therefore, proposes a vibration-based approach to assessing engine performance in CI engines. It hypothesizes that the variation in cylinder pressure with combustion can be effectively monitored via engine vibration signals. It further proposes the use of a hybrid calculus-statistical method for the analysis of the vibration data. Accordingly, tests were conducted using a single-cylinder engine made to operate on different fuel blends. Conventional thermodynamic data were recorded during its operation. These data were used to calculate fundamental engine performance indicators. Simultaneously, vibration data were collected from the engine using an accelerometer mounted on the engine casing. The vibration data were analyzed using a MATLAB algorithm. The results showed that the proposed method is able to track the variations in combustion performance, for changes in the fuel used. More importantly, based on the approach, a parameter, which characterizes the nature of combustion taking place, is proposed. The approach proves to be a feasible method for assessing combustion performance of different fuels in CI engines, with minimal computational requirements. © 2019 by ASME.

AB  - In-situ catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of bio-tar in supercritical ethanol for upgraded biofuel was investigated. Highly mesoporous KOH-treated AC (KOH-AC) was synthesized by chemical activation and used as the support for Ni-based catalysts. Among the tested catalysts (AC, KOH-AC, Mg-Ni-Mo/AC, and Mg-Ni-Mo/KOH-AC), Mg-Ni-Mo/KOH-AC with a high surface area of 1310.1 m2/g and a well-developed mesoporous structure exhibited much higher catalytic performance for the HDO of bio-tar. The effects of different reaction temperatures (300–400 °C) and residence time (0–120 min) on the HDO of bio-tar over Mg-Ni-Mo/KOH-AC were also examined. Enhanced properties of liquid fuel with a higher heating value (HHV) of 36.2 MJkg−1, an oxygen content of 11.7 wt%, and a total acid number (TAN) value of 8.6 mgKOHg−1 were obtained from bio-tar over a Mg-Ni-Mo/KOH-AC at 400 °C for 120 min. In these conditions, acids, aldehydes, and oxygenated phenols present in bio-tar (&gt;67 area%) were effectively converted to high value-added species including aromatics, hydrocarbons, and alkyl phenols in upgraded bio-tar (&gt;77 area%) via esterification, hydrogenation, deoxygenation, and ring-alkylation reactions. A series of Mg-Ni-Mo/KOH-AC catalyst recycle test showed the deposition of coke on the catalyst, which became a major reason for the catalyst deactivation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuel production from oilseed trees in small-scale agroforestry systems is considered as a strategy for energy security, rural development and ecosystem services provision in low-income countries. However, the economic potential of these systems remains unclear, as profitability studies commonly ignore key methodological issues such as quantitative uncertainty analysis, full accounting for opportunity costs, and inclusion of all value chain actors. This study addresses these methodological shortcomings and develops a framework for quantifying the long-term financial performance of agroforestry-based biofuel value chains. The framework is applied to a case in South India, to calculate profitability of pongamia (Millettia pinnata) cultivation and processing. The results show that pongamia cultivation has limited financial potential, and is only profitable in small-scale settings, in the middle to long term and for a subset of farmers. If biodiesel is envisaged as the end product, the value chain requires substantial fiscal and marketing support to be economically viable. For current prices, financial performance is much higher if the seed oil is marketed instead of processed to biodiesel. Increased mechanization, increased yields and optimized agroforestry set-ups might improve financial outcomes and reduce risks for both farmers and processors. These findings are case-specific, while the developed framework opens the door to comprehensive investigation of the financial performance of other oilseed tree species and in other regions. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Although usual in analytical chemistry, separations of volatile analytes by distillation are time-consuming, whereas gas diffusion through membranes is characterized by low efficiency. These limitations directly hinder sample throughput and sensitivity. In this work, a simple and inexpensive approach is proposed for separation of volatile analytes by microdistillation. It consists of an eppendorf type tube containing the acceptor solution suspended inside a 50 mL Falcon® capped tube containing the sample. The bottom of the sample tube is submitted to controlled heating in a water bath to promote analyte volatilization to the headspace, thus favoring its collection into the acceptor solution. The efficiency of the approach was evaluated by determination of methanol in biodiesel, whose threshold limit is 0.2% (m/m) according the current legislation. Measurements were based on discoloration of an acidic potassium permanganate solution (750 μL), caused by oxidation of methanol with consequent reduction to Mn(II). The analytical measurements were based on intensity of the reflected radiation acquired as digital images by the camera of a smartphone under controlled lighting. Values of the G channel were used as analytical parameter because of the complementarity with the color of the potassium permanganate solution. Under heating at 70 °C for 40 min, the transference of methanol to the acceptor solution was estimated at (98 ± 3)%. A linear response was achieved within 0.025% and 0.200% (m/m) methanol, with coefficient of variation (n = 10) and limit of detection (99.7% confidence level) estimated at 3.7% and 0.009% (m/m) respectively. The procedure requires only 100 μg of potassium permanganate and 200 μL of sample and generates as low as 950 μL of residue per determination. Because of the selectivity provided by microdistillation, the results obtained by the proposed approach agreed with the reference procedure at the 95% confidence level. The proposed approach is a simple, efficient, and cost-effective alternative for separation and determination of volatile species. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel production depends to a great extent on the use of cheap raw materials, since biodiesel itself is a mass product, not a high-value product. New processing methods, such as micro-flow continuous processing combined with enzymatic catalysis, open doors to the latter. As reported here, the window of opportunity in enzyme-catalyzed biodiesel production is the conversion of waste cooking oil. The main technological challenge for this is to obtain efficient immobilization of the lipase catalyst on beads. The beads can be filled into tubular reactors where designed packed-bed provide porous channels, forming micro-flow. It turns out, that in this way, the immobilization costs become the decisive economic factor. This paper reports a solution to that issue. The use of oil cake enables economic viability, which is not given by any of the commercial polymeric substrates used so far for enzyme immobilization. The costs of immobilization are mirrored in the earnings and cash flow of the new biotechnological process. © 2019

AB  - The present investigation emphasis on characteristics of pyrolysis products was obtained by intermediate pyrolysis of Aegle marmelos (AM) deoiled seed cake and appropriateness of engine adaptation. The superior volatile matter (73.69%) contented AM biomass was elected as the feed stock in this study. Pyrolysis experiment was done by a fixed bed reactor at 600°C and obtained 42–55% bio-oil yield. Investigation of bio-oil by GC/MS and FTIR established the occurrence of methyl, ester, alkanes, ketones and oxygenated chemicals have been alternates for fossil fuels. SEM and EDX analysis of bio-char exposes activated carbon and ensured that biochar can be used in the waste water treatment plant, solid fuel, organic fertilizer, and natural mosquito destroyer. According to GC analysis, the presence of CH4, H2, and C2H6 evolved syngas in AM pyrolysis process can be used C.I engines at dual fuel mode operation. An engine test reveals that adding of the pyrolysis oil diminished BTE (%) and increasing BSEC (MJ/kWhr). However, increasing bio-oil ratio blend with diesel reduces hazardous emissions like CO, HC, NOx, and smoke in the exhaust. Based on engine results, it was proposed that equal to 20% of AM bio-oil can be used as a fuel substitute for diesel engines. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 38:e13116, 2019. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Abstract: Biodiesel, a renewable and environment friendly biofuel is produced by transesterification process using animal fats and vegetable oils. However, the flourishing of biodiesel industries has led to produce a huge amount (10% v/v) of crude glycerol as a core by-product, created an overflow problem. Therefore, biotransformation of glycerol into biofuel and other value-added products is one of the promising applications of glycerol due to its high availability at low cost. In this study, we report the capability of converting glycerol as a sole carbon source to 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BDO) and acetoin by using a newly isolated Serratia proteamaculans SRWQ1 strain in batch biotransformation process under aerobic condition. Strain SRWQ1 displayed a maximum up to 18.43 ± 1.55 g/L of 2,3-BDO, yielding 0.4 g/g using 49.0 g/L glycerol which was 98.0% of glycerol utilization. The strain SRWQ1 also successfully produced a significant amount of acetoin 8.38 ± 0.76 g/L with yields 0.06 g/g. Moreover, the maximum activity of glycerol dehydrogenase (GDH) which is a key enzyme of glycerol metabolisms was 408.69 ± 0.069 units/mg protein. The newly isolated strain S. proteamaculans SRWQ1 displayed the best ability to synthesize 2,3-BDO and acetoin using glycerol as the sole substrate, and it is the first report on biotransformation of glycerol by S. proteamaculans. Therefore, this aerobic conversion of glycerol to value-added green products 2,3-BDO and acetoin with potential industrial applications would represent a noteworthy alternative to add value for biodiesel production helping biodiesel industries development.

AB  - To scientifically understand the emissions and chemistry of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in a typical petrochemical industrialized and dust-rich region of Northwest China, VOCs were measured at a receptor site in the Lanzhou Valley using a high-resolution online proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometer (PTR-MS). The ranking of VOC mixing ratios was methanol (32.72 ± 8.94 ppb) &gt; acetaldehyde (5.05 ± 2.4 ppb) &gt; acetic acid (3.42 ± 1.71 ppb). Lanzhou has higher oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) mixing ratios (methanol and acetaldehyde) and lower aromatics levels (benzene, toluene and C8-aromatics) compared with other cities. The positive matrix factorization (PMF) model showed eight sources of VOCs as follows: (1) mixed industrial process-1 (13.5%), (2) secondary formation (13.2%), (3) mixed industrial process-2 (11.8%), (4) residential biofuel use and waste disposal (13.80%), (5) solvent usage (10.1%), (6) vehicular exhaust (11.8%), (7) biogenic (13.8%) and (8) biomass burning (12.0%). Both the PSCF and the CWT results of mixed industrial process-1 were mainly from the northeast of Lanzhou and the biomass burning was from the southeast; the other four sources (without secondary formation and biogenic) were mainly from the west and northwest of Lanzhou, which were associated with the dust area of the Gobi Desert. A trajectory sector analysis revealed that the local emissions contributed 64.9–71.1% to the VOCs. OVOCs accounted for 43% of the ozone production potential (OFP), and residential biofuel use and waste disposal (25.1%), mixed industrial process-2 (15.3%) and solvent usage (13.4%) appeared to be the dominant sources contributors to O 3 production. The rank of main secondary organic aerosols (SOA) precursors under low-NOx conditions is xylene &gt; toluene &gt; benzene &gt; naphthalene &gt; styrene &gt; C10-aromatics &gt; isoprene, while under high-NOx conditions, it is toluene &gt; naphthalene &gt; xylene &gt; C10-aromatics &gt; styrene &gt; benzene &gt; isoprene. Solvent usage and vehicular exhaust appeared to be the dominant contributors to SOA formation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Winter oilseed rape (WOSR) is the main crop for biodiesel in the EU, where legislation demands at least 50% savings in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as compared to fossil diesel. Thus industrial sectors search for optimized management systems to lower GHG emissions from oilseed rape cultivation. Recently, pyrolysis of biomass with subsequent soil amendment of biochar has shown potentials for GHG mitigation in terms of carbon (C) sequestration, avoidance of fossil based electricity, and mitigation of soil nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions. Here we analyzed three WOSR scenarios in terms of their global warming impact using a life cycle assessment approach. The first was a reference scenario with average Danish WOSR cultivation where straw residues were incorporated to the soil. The others were biochar scenarios in which the oilseed rape straw was pyrolysed to biochar at two process temperatures (400 and 800 °C) and returned to the field. The concept of avoided atmospheric CO 2 load was applied for calculation of C sequestration factors for biochar, which resulted in larger mitigation effects than derived from calculations of just the remaining C in soil. In total, GHG emissions were reduced by 73 to 83% in the two biochar scenarios as compared to the reference scenario, mainly due to increased C sequestration. The climate benefits were higher for pyrolysis of oilseed rape straw at 800 than at 400 °C. The results demonstrated that biochar has a potential to improve the life cycle GHG emissions of oilseed rape biodiesel, and highlighted the importance of consolidated key assumptions, such as biochar stability in soil and the CO 2 load of marginal grid electricity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Experimental nozzle spray analysis of different nozzle sizes was performed to investigate the effect of the spray profile on combustion quality. Detailed numerical investigation analysis investigated the effect of discrete phase model (DPM) on liquid fuel atomization and combustion characteristics. Four injectors of 2.98, 5.95, 8.93, and 11.90 kg/h nominal capacities numbered from 1 to 4 were tested on new micro gas turbine (MGT) chamber designed especially for liquid biofuels. The fuel was tested in the range of 2.36 to 9.43 kg/h achieving stable turbine operation in the pressure range of 0.1 to 1 bar. Stable operation was achieved for injector number 2 in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 bar compared with 0.2 to 0.6 bar for injector number 3 and 0.5 to 1 bar for injector number 4, while the smallest injector number 1 was not operational above 0.1 bar. The experimental results produced favourable low CO emissions of 95 ppm, NOx emission of 31 ppm, and average turbine inlet temperature (TIT) of 1316 K at maximum pressure. The numerical simulation with DPM using similar injector and operating conditions showed good agreement with the experimental results averaging CO emissions of 99 ppm and NOx of 13 ppm at TIT of 1329 K. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The production of fuel from the hydrodeoxygenation of vegetable oils has been extensively investigated on account of the decline of petroleum-based fuels and increase of ecological problems. The conversion of jatropha oil over Al-MCM-41-supported Ni, W, and Ni-W catalysts was studied at 3 MPa and 360 °C. Over the monometallic Ni and W catalysts, the biofuel yield was low, about 19.3 and 12.5 wt %, respectively, whereas the highest biofuel yield reached 63.5 wt % over the Ni-W bimetallic catalysts. X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and high-resolution TEM results suggested that the proper amount of Ni and W would form a Ni17W3 active phase, the particle size of which varied with the content of Ni and W or preparation methods. The crystalline Ni17W3 phase formed when the content of both Ni and W reached 10%. With further increase of the content of W or Ni to 15%, the crystal size of Ni17W3 grew from 7 to 14 nm or to 20 nm, whereas the biofuel yield decreased with the increase of the Ni17W3 crystal size. The 10Ni-10W/Al-MCM-41 catalyst with the Ni17W3 crystal size of 7 nm showed the best performance for the transformation of jatropha oil into high-grade biofuel. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Hermetia illucens larvae oil (HILO) is among biofuel feedstock from insects that has high potential to reduce dependency on petroleum resources. The present paper is motivated by the need to critically examine the effect of HILO mixed with diesel fuel (DF) on combustion, engine performance, and emission characteristics of a single cylinder direct injection (DI) compression ignition (CI) engine. The experiment was performed at a constant speed of 1500 rpm under various engine loads. The results revealed that the in-cylinder pressure, heat release rate (HRR), and the ignition delay (ID) were reduced by an average of 3.32%, 12.89%, and 4.36%, respectively. The brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and exhaust gas temperature (EGT) increased considerably at all engine loads. The brake thermal efficiency (BTE) was discovered to be lower by 11.47% compared to DF. The finding also shows that carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and unburned hydrocarbon (UHC) emissions increased with the addition of HILO. The nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission reduced by 19.80% compared to DF at all the engine loads. Overall, this study concluded the potential of HILO in CI engine as a promising renewable and environmentally friendly resource for the better earth. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Water resistance and/or hydrothermal stability of catalysts are key concerns during the obtention of biofuels from fermentation products, which always involve considerable amounts of water. Herein, aimed at efficient upgrading of a water-containing acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation mixture to long-chain products, we designed and synthesized a series of 10 wt % Ni-MgO-SBA-16 catalysts, which were based on hydrophobic SBA-16 with highly condensed structures. These catalysts exhibited low water adsorptive capacities and relatively favorable hydrophobicity. As expected, the as-prepared catalysts showed excellent catalytic activity and water-tolerance: 76.4% conversion and 90.5% selectivity for C5-15 species were achieved under solvent-free conditions; when the initial water content increased to 7.4 wt %, comparable conversion and total selectivity for C5-15 species were also achieved. Besides, on account of the hydrophobic surface, monoalkylation products readily converted into doublealkylation ones even under conditions of high water content. The results demonstrated the 10 wt % Ni-MgO-SBA-16 catalysts acted as the role of "killing two birds with one stone": Promoting the water tolerance and exhibiting high hydrothermal stability; suppressing competitive adsorption of water molecules and facilitating the adsorption and transformation of hydrophobic intermediate 2-heptanone to long-chain hydrocarbons; replacing the rare noble metal by base metal and complying with the principles of "green chemistry". Overall, this work not only makes significant progress in value-adding of water-containing ABE but also provides the rational synthetic direction of catalysts requiring high hydrothermal stability and/or water resistance in the biomass conversion process. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The catalytic cracking of high–density polyethylene pyrolysis waxes under fluidized catalytic cracking conditions has been investigated with the aim of producing fuels at large–scale from waxes obtained in pyrolysis plants located nearby collection and segregation points. Additionally, preliminary information about the capacity of these units to valorize waste polyolefins has been obtained. The catalytic cracking runs have been performed in a riser simulator reactor under industrial conditions: 500–560 °C; catalyst to oil mass ratio, 3, 5 and 7 gcat goil −1; and, contact time, 6 s. The product distribution has been quantified determining the yields of different fractions, which have been defined according to their boiling point range: dry gas, liquefied petroleum gas, naphtha, light cycle oil, heavy cycle oil and coke. The concentration of the families of compounds has been also determined, which are n–paraffins, iso–paraffins, olefins, naphthenes and aromatics. For the shake of comparison, the results of catalytic cracking of a common stream fed to the industrial units, i.e., vacuum gasoil, have been included. Globally, promising results have been obtained in the valorization of waste polyolefins by means of this combination of pyrolysis–cracking stages that expose, at the same time, the capacity of this unit to manage waste plastics. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The growing demands on alternative fuels which can be used in present-day engines have imposed strong necessity on this proposal. Biofuels, the hydrocarbons less than C18, are believed to be the promising alternative fuel. In the present work, the abundantly available pongamia oil was experimented to produce biofuel using hydrothermally synthesized porous catalysts such as HZSM-5 and AlMCM-48 and synergistic composite catalyst AlMCM-48/HZSM-5. Characterization techniques such as XRD, BET, TPD, and TEM were used to study the characteristics of catalysts. The catalytic activity of the catalysts in cracking of pongamia oil at optimized reaction conditions—temperature, 400 °C; WHSV, 4.6 h−1; and reaction time, 1 h in a pilot scale stainless steel high pressure fixed bed reactor (100 ml volume; 15 mm id)—was studied. Among mesoporous AlMCM-48 with different Si/Al ratios, AlMCM-48 (27) efficiently cracked 69% of pongamia oil into 45% bioliquid products (BLP) with 34% and 44% selectivity towards green gasoline (GG). The composite catalyst was synthesized with the most active microporous catalyst (HZSM-5) as core and mesoporous material AMCM-48(Si/Al = 27) as a shell. The composite material AlMCM-48/HZSM-5 proved to be an excellent catalyst in converting 97% of pongamia oil into 70% bioliquid hydrocarbons with 70% selectivity towards gasoline. The calorific value (ASTM D 240) of the biofuel was observed to be higher, while the viscosity (ASTM D 445) and specific gravity (ASTM D 1298) were found to be lower than biodiesel produced through transesterification process.

AB  - This study investigated the dual application of Scenedesmus obliquus for wastewater phycoremediation and biochemical component accumulation in microalgal cells. The microalgae grown in wastewater showed micro-elements uptake and removal efficiencies of 71.2 ± 3.5% COD, 81.9 ± 3.8% NH 4 + , ∼100.0% NO 3 − , and 94.1 ± 4.7% PO 4 3− . The growth profile of Scenedesmus obliquus indicated a specific growth rate of 0.42 ± 0.02 1·d −1 and carrying capacity of 0.88 ± 0.04 g L −1 . The lipid, protein, and carbohydrate yields (w·w −1 of dry weight) were 26.5 ± 1.5%, 28.5 ± 1.5%, and 27.5 ± 1.6%, respectively. The de-oiled biomass was subjected to biochemical extraction, achieving protein and carbohydrate yields of 25.3 ± 1.4% and 21.4 ± 1.2%, respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed several functional groups (e.g., N[sbnd]H, CH 3 , CH 2 , C[dbnd]O, C[sbnd]N, P[dbnd]O, and Si[sbnd]O) on the biomass surface, confirming the accumulation of biochemical elements in microalgae. The thermal analysis of microalgal biomass depicted sequential stages of dehydration (60–190 °C), devolatilization (200–490 °C), and solid residue decomposition (490–600 °C). The cost-benefit analysis of microalgae cultivated in wastewater was derived regarding amortization and operating costs and energy and environmental benefits. The net profit of phycoremediation was 16885 US$·y −1 , resulting in a payback period of 14.8 years (i.e., shorter than the project lifetime). Accordingly, the proposed phycoremediation process was economically viable. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The thermoxidation of biodiesel was monitored using different spectroscopic techniques: UV–Vis and MIR absorption, Raman spectroscopy, and visible fluorescence. As the oxidation progressed, the UV–Vis absorption spectra showed an increase in the spectral range between 34,000 and 26,000 cm −1 , while two main fluorescence bands (under ultraviolet excitation) were observed at around 21,000 and 15,000 cm −1 . The UV–Vis absorption and fluorescence intensities presented opposite behavior during the processes, irrespective of the temperature used (90, 140, or 190 °C). These effects could be explained by the consumption of natural antioxidants, followed by the formation of primary oxidation compounds. The Raman and MIR absorption results indicated the existence of a cis-trans isomerization effect, followed by the formation of hydroperoxides during the oxidation, with the behavior being the same as that revealed by the UV–Vis absorption and fluorescence analyses. The comparison, under the same conditions, of different spectroscopy techniques that can be used to monitor the stages of thermoxidation of soybean biofuel provides important information for selection of an appropriate technique for evaluating biodiesel integrity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present work reconnoitres the feasibility of utilizing class F fly ash and calcined animal bone powder (CABP) as raw material for the synthesis of heterogeneous solid base catalyst with varying ratios (CABP of 10, 20, and 30 mass%), that is subsequently used for transesterification of mustard oil. Physicochemical characterization of CABP revealed crystalline behavior, signifying one of the components as hydroxyapatite (HAP); when calcined at 900 °C transforms to β–tricalcium phosphate having a specific surface area of 100 m 2 g −1 . The synthesized catalyst showed improved catalytic activity when compared to the parental species and the optimal value to achieve the highest conversion of 90.4% would be at CABP loading of 10 mass%, 5.5:1 methanol to oil molar ratio, and 10 mass% catalyst concentration for 6 h. The prepared biodiesel had a calorific value of 36.2 MJ kg −1 with ash content &lt; 0.01 mass%. The catalyst could be reused five times with no loss in its activity. Results indicated that calcium enriched waste materials when impregnated in fly ash might be a potential source of catalyst in biodiesel production. © 2019

AB  - The pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass generates a liquid product, known as pyrolysis oil, that can be further processed into biofuels and value-added chemicals. During pyrolysis, cellulose and hemicelulose fractions are converted into a range of water-soluble sugar derivatives, for which several valorisation strategies exist. On the other hand, lignin is broken down into so-called pyrolytic lignin, a water-insoluble complex mixture of aromatic oligomers that requires different upgrading strategies than the sugar rich fraction. Here, we report an experimental study on the valorisation of pyrolytic lignin via catalytic hydrotreatment in the absence of an external solvent. A variety of carbon-supported noble-metal heterogeneous catalysts were tested (Ru/C, Pd/C, Pt/C and Rh/C), as well as conventional hydrotreatment catalysts (sulphided NiMo/Al2O3 and CoMo/Al2O3) to obtain valuable low molecular weight aromatic and phenolic compounds. Overall, depolymerized liquids were obtained with organic yields of up to 63 wt%. Pd/C was shown to be the best catalyst, yielding 59 wt% of monomers based on the organic product (i.e. 33 wt% based on pyrolytic lignin intake). While noble metal catalysts favored higher monomer yields, though with some over-reduction of aromatic rings to saturated hydrocarbons, sulphided catalysts were more efficient in deoxygenation and aromatization reactions, but yielded less monomers. The hydrocracking efficiency was shown to be strongly dependent on the reaction temperature. Based on the experimental data, a global reaction network is proposed. The high monomer yields reveal the potential of catalytic hydrotreatment for the upgrading of pyrolytic lignin into valuable phenolics and aromatics. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - As fuel additives, ethyl levulinate (EL) can be used up to 5 wt% directly in the regular diesel engines, which can overcome the limited stock of fossil fuels and reduce the environment pollutions to some extent. In this work, the three-dimensional porous hybrids consisting of SiO2 and graphene aerogel, which are denoted as SiO2@GA, are facilely assembled and used as supports for H3PW12O40 (HPW)-based solid acid catalysts. Structural analysis confirms that the resultant HPW/SiO2@GA catalysts possess unique porous structure (SBET ≥ 257 m2 g−1, Vp ≥ 0.450 cm3 g−1) and exhibit excellent catalytic performance in the synthesis of EL by the esterification of levulinic acid (LA) with ethanol. The conversion of LA can be as high as 92.4% under the reaction conditions. Furthermore, various catalytic reaction parameters are also optimized over the 10 wt.% HPW/SiO2@GA catalysts, which exhibit the highest turnover frequency (TOF = 83.91 mmol g−1 h−1) among the resultant catalysts. The results confirm the promising application of the HPW/SiO2@GA heterogeneous catalysts in the synthesis of biofuel. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In this work, we extend the Group Contribution with Association Equation of State (GCA-EOS) to model the phase behavior of mixtures comprising ethers and alcohols. The model parametrization was done using few binary vapor-liquid equilibrium data sets of linear monoethers. We also model the behavior of branched ethers, traditionally used as fuel additives, as well as that of polyethers, which are nowadays being proposed as potential biofuels. Therefore, we investigate not only the phase equilibria but also excess enthalpies of these three types of ethers in mixtures with alcohols. Finally, we show that the GCA-EOS is able to predict the phase behavior of polyethers, as well as that of branched ethers, using a group contribution approach. This work is part of a broader project for the development of a robust and predictive thermodynamic model for process and product design in the context of biomass valorization. In addition, the parametrization reported here aims to provide a reliable framework specific for the description of thermodynamic properties of biofuel blends. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Deoxygenation and molecular structural modification is a critical step before the practical application of triglycerides in aviation biofuels. For low quality waste triglycerides with high viscosity, traditional way of direct hydrogenation usually has problems such as catalyst deactivation and pipe clogging. Herein, we demonstrate a facile catalytic biorefinery process for high viscosity waste triglycerides for the production of aviation biofuels via a two-step catalytic conversion. Several typical plant oils (soybean and rubber seed oils) and waste triglycerides (waste cooking and acidified plant oils) are tested, which indicate that this approach is widely applicable, and can be used to produce aviation range products, linear hydrocarbons, at high yields (55%–60%), accompanied by a diesel range fuel of 15%–40% by adjusting the operation parameters. The aviation range hydrocarbons are further catalyzed by an Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst to achieve aromatization and hydrogenation in a one-pot synthesis. Three dominant components existing in aviation fuels, including chain hydrocarbons, aromatics and cycloalkanes, can be obtained, which present the same physical-chemical properties and components as petroleum-based aviation fuels. The proportion of the three main components can be modified by the amount of molecular sieve catalyst and the initial pressure of H 2 , in order to meet the requirements of variable-grade aviation fuels. Overall, a catalytic refining process of decarboxylation and molecular structural modification of low quality waste triglycerides for the entire/total substitution of petroleum aviation fuels from waste triglyceride is reported. © 2019

AB  - The vast increase of municipal solid waste (MSW) generated in Zimbabwe coupled with a severe energy crisis have made waste-to-energy technology more attractive and necessary. Coal-alternative solid fuel production from MSW though hydrothermal carbonization can play a critical role to improve both waste management and energy supply. Moreover, MSW conversion to a carbon neutral solid fuel that can be burnt in existing coal-fired power stations might reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions despite GHG releases from waste collection, waste conversion to fuel, and fuel transportation processes. The purpose of this paper is to investigate present MSW generation in Zimbabwe, its characteristics as a fuel source, and the impact of coal-alternative solid fuel production from MSW using hydrothermal carbonization technology on GHG and other air pollutant emissions. Four different scenarios based on the balance between fuel supply and demand were tested in this paper. The results suggest 0.54 ± 0.14 kg/capita/day of MSW generation in Zimbabwe and about 1051.7 ± 270.7 Gg of annual MSW generation from the current urban population. 289.3 Gg of coal-alternative solid fuel production was expected from domestic MSW collectable in urban areas. The model predicted that co-burning of alternative fuel in coal-fired power plants could reduce the methane potential of household waste from 62,200 to 15,800 Mg CH 4 per year. Under the best possible scenario, it could reduce SO x emissions by 4.2%, CH 4 emissions by 4.5%, CO 2 emissions by 3.1%, and Global Warming Potential by 2.2%. On the other hand, NO x emissions would increase by 18%. If without additional installation of air pollutant control devices in power plants, waste-to-energy generates a trade-off between global warming and acid rain. In addition, geological locations generate a large demand/supply gap of alternative fuel and regulate maximum available consumption of alternative fuel. © 2019

AB  - This research evaluates the possibility of using straight oils such as castor oil, which is not suitable for food use, and sunflower oil, used as a standard reference for waste cooking oils, in blends with gasoline as second-generation biofuels. To this end, a study of the rheological properties of biofuels obtained from these double blends has been carried out. The aim is to take advantage of the different properties of gasoline, i.e., its low viscosity and its high energy density to obtain blends whose rheological properties allow the substitution of fossil diesel in high extent. The incorporation of fossil diesel to these gasoline/oil mixtures produces diesel/gasoline/oil triple blends, which exhibited the suitable rheological properties to be able to operate in conventional diesel engines. Therefore, the behavior of these blends has been evaluated in a conventional diesel engine, operating as an electricity generator. The triple blends allow the substitution of fossil diesel up to 40% with sunflower oil, and up to 25% with castor oil, with excellent power results achieved for blends in which diesel is substituted up to 40%, and also in fuel consumption at high demand in comparison to conventional fossil diesel. Besides, a significant reduction in the emission of pollutants has also been obtained with these triple blends. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The valorization of organic waste through biodiesel synthesis was investigated to explore the concept of hazardous waste-to-energy. Fish waste (mackerel waste) was chosen as a case study because of the growing concern regarding the treatment of food waste, which is potentially hazardous to the environment. This study focused on the thermally-induced transesterification of fish waste for the production of biodiesel (i.e., fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs)). This process requires a porous material that allows for the collision between reactants (fish waste and methanol) to increase inside its pores at high temperatures. Therefore, commercial clay (montmorillonite) was used as the porous material in this study. The optimal temperature for the thermally-induced transesterification of unpurified mackerel oil was 380 °C, and the FAME recovery reached up to ˜72 wt.%. This study also proved that thermal cracking of polyunsaturated FAME species was initiated at temperatures ≥390 °C, and that fish waste is a promising feedstock for biodiesel when it is produced via thermally-induced transesterification over clay as a porous material. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The objective of this study was to find the optimal condition for the extraction of rubber seed oil (RSO), using liquefied dimethyl ether (DME). Response surface methodology with a spherical central composite design model was employed to determine the optimal extraction condition, consisting of a seed moisture content (%wt), a solvent to solid ratio (g/g), and an extraction temperature (°C). A quadratic regression equation suggested the optimal extraction condition was a moisture content of 56.4%wt, a solvent to solid ratio of 6.7 (g/g), and a temperature of 33.3 °C. At this condition, the RSO yield predicted by the model gave a slight deviation of 0.68% from the experimentally validated results (41.48 versus 41.20%). RSO has a kinematic viscosity of 36.8 cSt, an acid value of 10.7 KOH/g oil, a fatty acid content of 5.1% and an unsaturated fatty acid content of 80%, resulting in the potential production of biodiesel, biolubricants, and biodegradable plastics. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Suitable fluorescence tracers (“dyes”) are needed for the planar measurement of droplet sizes by using a combination of laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and Mie scattering. Currently, no suitable tracers have been characterized for application in planar droplet sizing in gasoline and kerosene fuels, as well as biofuel blends. One promising tracer is nile red, which belongs to the fluorophore group. For its utilization for droplet size measurements, preliminary characterization of the fluorescence of the respective fuel tracer mixtures are mandatory. For this purpose, the fluorescence and absorption behavior of nile red dissolved in the surrogate fuels Toliso and Jet A-1 as well as in biofuel blends was investigated. The fluorescence signal for nile red that was dissolved in the two base fuels Toliso and Jet A-1 showed a linear behavior as a function of dye concentration. The temperature effect on spectral absorption and emission of nile red was investigated in a specially designed test cell. An ethanol admixture to Toliso led to a spectral shift towards higher wavelengths. The absorption and emission bands were shifted towards lower wavelengths with increasing temperature for all fuels. Both absorption and fluorescence decreased with increasing temperature for all fuels, except for E20, which showed an increased fluorescence signal with increasing temperature. Jet A-1 and its blends with hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) and farnesane did not exhibit explicit variations in spectral absorption or emission, but these blends showed a more distinct temperature dependence compared to the Toliso-ethanol-blends. The effect of photo-dissociation of the LIF signal of the fuel tracer mixtures was studied, and all fuel mixtures besides Toliso showed a more or less distinct decay in the fluorescence signal with time. In summary, all investigated fuel-tracer mixtures are suitable for LIF/Mie ratio droplet sizing in combination with nile red at moderate temperatures and low evaporation cooling rates. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The utilization of biofuels in IC engines have been increased and trending area of research due to the sustainability of butanol and algae fuels. As these fuels are readily available and the route of production of these fuels is also not limited. Because of the technological advancements and demand of alternative fuels, the operating conditions of IC Engines are becoming stringent, precise and more demanding. Further, it is very well established fact that the emissions of engine depends on the performance of fuel, type of fuel blends and ratio of blending. Therefore, it is more important that the type of fuel or fuel blends may be selected in such a way that it may provide the optimal performance. The review of the available experimental studies shows that the performance and emission characteristics of butanol and algae oil fuel blends with gasoline are limited in SI Engines. Thus, there is need to carry out the experimental studies related to the emissions of butanol and algae oil fuel blends in SI Engines. Further, the use of butanol and algae oil may be good alternative fuel or may be added to gasoline. © 2020 Phcogj.Com.

AB  - Levulinic acid (LA) has been ranked as one of the “Top 10" building blocks for future bio-refineries as proposed by the US Department of Energy. It is considered one of the most important platform molecules for the production of fine chemicals and fuels based on its compatibility with existing processes, market economics, and industrial ability to serve as a platform for the synthesis of important derivatives. Hydrogenation of LA to produce γ-valerolactone (GVL) is an active area of research due to the potential of GVL to be used as a biofuel in its own right and for its subsequent transformation into hydrocarbon fuels. This paper contains a new design for a simple, cost effective, and safe hydrogenation reactor for the transformation of levulinic acid to γ-valerolactone (GVL) by utilizing high boiling point organic fluid. The hydrogenation reactor is composed of a heating source-organic fluid (called “DOWTHERM A” or “thermex”) and the catalytic reactor. The advantages of high boiling temperature fluids, along with advances in hydrocracking and reforming technologies driven by the oil and gas industries, make the organic concept more suitable and safer (water coming in contact with liquid metal is well understood in the metallurgical industry to be a steam explosion hazard) for heating the hydrogenation reactor. COMSOL multi-physics software version 4.3b was applied in this work and simultaneously solves the continuity, Navier-Stokes (fluid flow), energy (heat transfer), and diffusion with chemical reaction kinetics equations. It was shown that the heat flux supplied by the DOWTHERM A organic fluid could provide the necessary heat flux required for maintaining the hydrogenation process. It was found that the mass fractions of hydrogen and levulinic acid decreased along the reactor axis. The GVL mass fraction increased along the reactor axis. © 2019 by the author.

AB  - Biodiesel is one the several alternate fuels which has good potential of being used as a fuel for combustion process in compression ignition engines. The fact that biodiesel can be obtained from a renewable source of energy also addresses the problem of energy security. This research work was based on experiments conducted using mahua oil biodiesel. Methoxide formed by mixing methanol with potassium hydroxide was used to prepare the biodiesel. Biodiesel was made by using two-step transesterification. A yield of 86% was obtained for mahua oil. Blends of B5(5% Mahua biodiesel, 95% diesel v/v), B10, B15, B20 and B25 was made from the biodiesel obtained after transesterification. Physio-chemical properties such as the kinematic viscosity, acid value, flash point and cloud point etc were determined. The two-step transesterification process improved the cold flow properties of mahua biodiesel. The results obtained were conclusive of the fact that the blending of mahua biodiesel and mineral diesel is capable of improving physical and chemical properties as well as the cold-flow properties of biodiesel. © TJPRC Pvt.

AB  - Emission characteristics and performance of biodiesel blends with 10%, 20%, 30% and 50% from fuel of SchleicheraOleosa oil, in accordance with hydrodynamic cavitation were distinguished as diesel fuel, in this work to recognize effectuality based on EN 14214 and ASTMD 6751 standards. SOME (SchleicheraOleosa Oil Methyl Ester) is mixed with diesel in 10%, 20%, 30% and 50% proportion by volume, here pure diesel is utilized as fuel and second fuel (biodiesel) is with blends of Neem oil. Neem oil helps preparing biodiesel; with transesterification procedure by adding 1% of v/v H2SO4 and third fuel are crude rice bran and rice bran biodiesel and its associated blends with diesel for enhancing diesel engine performance. Single cylinder four stroke diesel engine at diverse loading condition assists in carrying out the experiment, with blended fuel at 1500 rpm rated speed. From the experimental result, it is confirmed that diesel efficiency is superior and brake fuel consumption is lesser at loads with diesel and SOME blends. Outcomes demonstrate that superior performance and lower emissions for B10 than diesel and subsequent blends, for rice bran and neem biodiesel. Brake thermal efficiency is superior when compared with HC, diesel and CO and NOX emissions were 23%, 8.5%, and 22% smaller to diesel. Biodiesel acquired from biological materials is attaining huge interest and also it behaves as an alternative fuel. This examination distinguished with biodiesel quality produced from palm kernel oil (PKO) and lipase-transesterified palm oil (PO) based on fuel properties and fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). Jatropha biodiesel and Turpentine oil (methyl ester) is low and high viscosity fuels in co-operated with diesel heating value; this leads to conducive for utilization in diesel engine. © TJPRC Pvt.

AB  - As a green material, date pit oil is increasingly utilized as an inexpensive feedstock for ethyl ester (biodiesel) production. Waste date pits as a raw material are one of the highly produced agricultural wastes in Iran. This study investigated the effect of several procedure parameters including the ethanol/oil molar ratio, reaction temperature and amount of catalysts on the yield of the produced ethyl ester. The activity of date pit oil can be considered a method of second-generation biofuels production including green diesel fractions. Efficient from waste date pits and synthesis of ethyl ester have made a breakthrough in biodiesel production. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) were employed to determine the composition of product. The optimized ethyl ester yield obtained was 92% when the procedure temperature was 65 °C, within 6h, with 7:1 ethanol/oil molar ratio with 0.75 wt.% of catalyst (KOH). Waste date pits oil as feedstock can be an efficient platform for ethyl ester production. The purified ethyl ester satisfies the stringent quality standards imposed by ASTM D-6751 (USA standard) and EN-14214 (European standard). © 2019, Iranian Chemical Society.

AB  - This study focuses on the evaluation of soybean hulls as an alternative to obtain biofuels and bioproducts through pyrolysis. The study was carried out in three stages: 1) The physicochemical characteristics of the raw material were determined, 2) Yields of different pyrolysis products were obtained at 350, 400 and 600 °C; 3) The different obtained products (biochar, bio-oil and non-condensable gases) were characterized. The results obtained revealed that the soybean hulls used in this study present a 76% volatile mater and 2.3% ash. The highest pyrolysis yields obtained for bio-oil (40%) and non-condensable gases (36%) were achieved at 600 °C. The main compounds identified in the aqueous phase of bio-oil were acetic acid, furfural, furfural alcohol, 1,2-cyclopentadiene, among others. The organic phase of bio-oil presented a calorific power of 23.7 MJkg−1. Calorific power in the ranges 19–21 MJm−3 and 26.6–28.1 MJkg−1 were obtained for the biogas and the biochar obtained at different temperatures, respectively. © 2019

AB  - The continuous rise of fuel prices and environmental concern due to emission from diesel engines has intensified the research in clean alternative fuels for improving the performance and emission of multi-cylinder turbocharged diesel engines. This makes ethanol and butanol attractive clean and renewable biofuels which are viewed promising on the grounds that they can be produced from biological matter through well-known procedures. In addition, many of their physical-chemical properties are agreeable with the needs of present engines, which make them appealing either as substitution for fossil fuels or as fuel additives. In this study, the impact of ethanol-diesel (5E, 15E and 25E) and butanol-diesel (5B, 15B and 25B) on the performance and emission of a six-cylinder, four-stroke and turbocharged compression ignition (CI) diesel engine were investigated using GT-Power computational simulation package. The numerical simulations were performed at constant engine speed of 1800 r/min and four distinct loads of brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) (4.5 bar, 7.5 bar, 10.5 bar and 12.75 bar). The performance and exhaust emissions of the engine when working with ethanol-diesel and butanol-diesel blends were compared with each other and with neat diesel fuel operation. The brake thermal efficiency (BTE) values for blends were found to be slightly higher in comparison with diesel fuel operation. With respect to emissions, the results showed that carbon dioxide (CO2) and unburned hydrocarbon (HC) emissions for ethanol and butanol blends increased compared with that of diesel fuel operations while emissions of carbon monoxide and oxides of Nitrogen (NOX) decreased. Butanol showed better performance in terms of BTE and reduced emissions (i.e. more than 70% reduction in NOX and 40% in CO) as compared with ethanol. © 2019, Asian Association for Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - In the world there are two main problems concerning energy and ecology. Despite the crude oil price fluctuation, it has tended to increase. Moreover fossil fuel burning emits hazard compounds, including greenhouse gas. To solve them alternative fuels for vehicle have to be used. In due to properties, their usage impacts on the engine efficiency. The alternative fuel usage needs additional investment costs on the vehicle engines adaptation and fuel supply infrastructure. So, decisions must be based on mathematical apparatus. Three submodels were used in the suggested mathematical model: energy and economic indicator for fuels; energy and economic indicator for vehicles; criteria for investment projects. As a criterion of investment projects the profitability index has been grounded. The mathematical model and the algorithm for determining the feasibility of the alternative fuel utilization have been developed. The proposed algorithm includes the following stages: calculation of the fuel energy cost; calculation of the criteria for vehicles; determining the maximum value of investments; making decisions. Biofuels and gaseous fuels for some countries have been studied. The economic attractiveness of the alternative transport fuels has been presented. According to mathematical modeling, gaseous fuels are more economically attractive compared with liquid biofuels. Among gaseous fuels, LPG has a higher economic efficiency. The economic margin of alternative fuel application feasibility has been determined. © 2019 Antonina Kalinichenko et al., published by Sciendo.

AB  - The usage of biodiesel as a source in diesel engines is prevalent in recent years in the aim of reducing emission that are produced when using diesel. Researches are undergoing in the fields of alternative fuels to improve the energy content and combustibility of biofuels used in engines. Biodiesel being a renewable energy source is widely used as an alternative for fossil fuel. In this test octanol (Oct) is added to neem biodiesel (NBD) and diesel (D) as an additive to create the fuel blends and its impact upon performance and emission characteristics are evaluated. The fuel properties are found be improved on using higher alcohol additives such as octanol which is having high energy content as well as high cetane number and are also easily miscible in biodiesel and diesel. From the experiment conducted on diesel engine using both diesel as well as with prepared blends, significant decrease for all emission associated with neem biodiesel, diesel and octanol blends was found without any substantial loss of performance compared with results while using neat diesel. The results indicate that blending octanol with biodiesel blends is a viable option as alternative fuel source for CI engines. © BEIESP.

AB  - Alternative sources of energy are greatly needed to ensure the availability of fuels in the long run. Microalgae-derived fuels are among the viable options due to their potential to produce sustainable fuels. However, the costs related to the production of microalgal and alternative fuels are still higher compared to conventional fuels. To deal with costs and environmental issues, the blending of microalgal fuels with conventional fuels can be considered as one of the feasible options. Blending has a positive impact on many fuel characteristics including reduction of carbon footprint, costs, freezing point, viscosity, flow, heating and combustion. In this study, jet fuel from Nannochloropsis sp crude bio-oil was blended with Jet A1 in 50/50 volume ratio. The data generated from the 50/50 blend jet fuel were analysed according to the ASTM standards. Samples were tested after 30, 60, 90 and 120 days from the production day. It was reported that majority of parameters including Net heat of combustion, flash point, kinematic viscosity, conductivity and freezing point were compliant with ASTM standards. However, parameters such as density and total acidity were found not complying with ASTM standards. This study can have an implication on carbon footprint reduction because of the blending of fossil-based jet fuel and renewable-based jet fuel known as low carbon footprint fuel. The blending ratio can be beneficial for the green energy world in terms of costs and environmental impacts. © The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press.

AB  - The Swietenia macrophylla wood used for the study was sun dried for about 48 h, pulverized using a hammer mill and then sieved to a particle size of about 425μm using Wiley milling machine. The prepared materials were pyrolyzed in a fixed-bed pyrolysis reactor in the temperature range from 425 to 500 °C. The product yields were collected at an interval of 25 °C. The maximum yield of bio-oil was recorded as 69.5wt.% at the pyrolysis temperature of 450 °C. The physicochemical properties and compositions of the feed materials and produced bio-oil were measured in order to quantify their potential for bio-energy use and industrial applications. The properties specifically measured include density, moisture content, ash content, pH, refractive index, cetane index, elemental composition, viscosity, and heating values. The ultimate analysis of the product showed that the contents of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur were 50.2%, 42.6%, 6.6%, &lt;0.4% and &lt;0.06% respectively. The viscosity, density, pH, moisture content, API gravity, ash content, HHV and LHV of bio-oil produced were found to be 4.6 mm2/s, 0.951 g/ml, 5.64, 21.4wt.%, 19.29, 0.15wt%, 29.52 MJ/kg and 28.08 MJ/kg respectively. These values were found to be in the ranges of values reported in the literature for bio-oils produced from biomass. The produced bio-oil had the much needed organic compounds typical of other woody biomass employed in commercial bio-oil manufacture. These compounds were classified into several groups; organic acids, ketones, phenols, alcohols, and aldehydes. The main components identified in the bio-oil are the aromatic and aliphatic compounds as well as carboxyl groups. The GCMS analysis of the product indicated the presence of 24 compounds which are useful as industrial chemicals and flammable gases: they include alkanes, alkenes, phenols, hydrogen, and levoglucosan. This study on bio-oil has demonstrated that mahogany wood is a useful biomass for the much sort potential fossil fuel substitute and finds vast application in the biofuel industry. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - In this work, the thermal catalytic cracking of waste chicken fat on a coal fly ash catalyst was investigated. The objectives were to find the optimizing condition to produce the maximum biofuel using a 2k factorial level experimental design and to study the kinetics of the reaction. The experiment was performed in a laboratory scale 70-mL micro-reactor, and the obtained biofuel from the cracking process was analyzed by simulated distillation gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Furthermore, the fuel properties and elemental analysis of the biofuel were characterized. The effects of the temperature (420-460 °C), reaction time (45-75 min), catalyst loading (1-5% by weight; wt%) and an initial hydrogen (H2) pressure (100-500 kPa) on biofuel and gasoline yield were analyzed by analysis of variance. The main parameters were the reaction temperature and time. The optimum conditions, derived from using the design-expert software, was a reaction temperature and time of 444.4 °C and 45.50 min, respectively, with 1 wt% catalyst and an initial H2 pressure of 100 kPa to obtain a maximum yield of 76.2 wt% biofuel with 24.0 wt% gasoline. The acid value was decreased 3.9-fold to 13.5 mgKOH g-1, whereas the heating value was increased 1.10-fold to 42.92 MJ kg-1, which is slightly lower than that for commercial diesel. The kinetics were determined based on experimental data for temperatures from 410 to 470 °C and best fitted to a second order rate with an apparent activation energy and pre-exponential factor of 86.0 kJ mol-1 and 181.3 s-1, respectively. The possible reaction pathway commenced from the hydrolysis of triglyceride to heavy oxygenated compounds followed by carboxylation, carbonylation and hydrogenation to become heavy linear hydrocarbons (HCs), then the heavy linear HC might be thermally and catalytically cracked into middle or small paraffins and olefins. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study investigated the potential of a blend of neem-rubber seed oil together with calcined husk of elephant-ear tree pod as catalyst for biodiesel production via transesterification aided with microwave irradiation. The essential process parameters involved in biodiesel production were optimized using central composite rotatable design combined with response surface methodology. The free fatty acid of the blend of neem and rubber seed oils in ratio 60:40 used in this work was effectively reduced from 17.76 to 0.67% using methanol/oil blend ratio of 25:1, catalyst [Fe2(SO4)3] dosage of 10 wt.%, reaction time of 120 min and reaction temperature of 65 °C. The E. cyclocarpum pod husk ash was calcined at 700 °C for 4 h and characterized. The results obtained show that the calcined ash is rich in K, Mg, Ca and Fe, which was responsible for its high catalytic activity. The optimal condition established for the microwave-assisted transesterification of the Fe2(SO4)3-pretreated oil blend was methanol/oil blend molar ratio of 11.44:1, catalyst dosage of 2.96 wt.% and reaction time of 5.88 min under microwave heating power of 150 W with a corresponding biodiesel yield of 98.77 ± 0.16 wt.%. The fuel properties of biodiesel produced were within the standard specifications. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The current study focuses on the valorization potential of Indigofera tinctoria L. waste biomass recovered from the indigo dye production process for biofuel and compost. In order to compare the potential of after dye extracted biomass (ADB) with before dye extracted biomass (BDB), different physical (proximate analysis, calorific value, thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD)), chemical (ultimate analysis, inorganic elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)), and compositional characterization (cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and extractive content) were performed. With C/N ratio of 19.66 and high mineral contents (P = 1513.47 and K = 5672.63 ppm), ADB showed favorable potential for compost. Additionally, the ultimate composition (C = 44.23%, H = 6.62%, N = 2.25%, and O = 37.94%) and lignocellulosic composition (cellulose = 41.15%, hemicellulose = 28.9%) of ADB indicated comparable methane (498.94 L/kg VS) and ethanol (281.9 L/Mg) potential. Considering the overall biomass potential, an integrated approach has been suggested to utilize ADB for biofuels (biogas and bioethanol) and compost production. This approach may enhance the eco-sustainability by substituting the current energy and fertilizer need in Indigofera biomass cultivation and indigo dye production processes with a predicted energy equivalent of 3709.68 MJ (from biogas) or 1131.56 MJ (from bioethanol) per 240 kg dry weight of ADB.

AB  - Acidic hydrolysis process of wet microalgae is a worthy technique to reduce the processes and energy of the production. To aim the alternative fuel as a biofuel feedstock from wet microalgae, the Spirulina platensis containing high moisture, 88–95 wt%, was representative in this research. Microalgae cell disruption by acidic hydrolysis was investigated using various concentrations of sulfuric acid with the hydrolysis temperature in the range of 25–100 °C and hydrolysis time in the range of 30–120 min. The acid-hydrolyzed lipid was extracted from the mixture by solvent extraction using n-hexane. The maximum lipid concentration from acidic hydrolysis was 17.15 wt% that obtained at hydrolysis temperature of 100 °C for 60 min and then extracted with 700 mL of hexane for 30 min. The physical and chemical analyses of the lipid and microalgae solid residue were examined. According to the research results, the higher heating values of hydrolyzed lipid were found in the range of 32–40 MJ/kg and their main chemical components were hexadecane, heptadecane, and palmitic acid. The boiling point ranges of the hydrolyzed lipid were mainly indicated in the fractions of light and heavy gas oils which may be generated in term of biofuel feedstock for automobile fuels. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Olive mill wastewater sludge (OMWS) and waste tires (WTs), abundant wastes in Tunisia, were used as feedstock in a slow co-pyrolysis pilot reactor to produce upgraded pyrolytic oil as an alternative fuel. Despite the improvement of some properties of the pyrolytic oil when waste tires were added in the feed blend, a negative synergy was observed in the yield of the oil compared with that of char. The characterization of oil samples showed synergetic interaction between OMWS and WTs during co-pyrolysis which led to a partial deoxygenation and resulted in reduction of viscosity and increase in the calorific value of the co-pyrolytic oils. However, the co-pyrolytic oil properties did not meet the requirements of commercial diesel and will need further improvement by effective standardization to meet marketable specifications. Compared with catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) followed by hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), OMWS/WTs slow co-pyrolysis showed some limitations but it can be considered as a simple, clean and cheap process upgrading technique for bio-oil production (∼40% lower in fixed capital investment and ∼30% lower in fuel selling price). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present work investigated the potential of the green alga Chlorella vulgaris to produce high-quality biofuel under culture stress conditions. The cultivation was carried out in a 1000 l open plate tank system, which provides biomass yields comparable to open pond systems, but with less area needed. Algal biomass and lipid content were measured repeatedly. We compared the two solvent systems n-hexane and hexane/isopropanol (HIP) for extraction efficiency of lipids and applied three different extraction methods Soxhlet, soaking, and soaking followed by Soxhlet (soak-Sox). The combination of the HIP solvent and the soak-Sox provided the highest lipid yield (15.8 ± 0.174). Volumetric biomass and lipid productivity were 0.201 g l−1 day−1 and 31.71 mg l−1 day−1, respectively, whereas areal biomass and lipid productivity were 25.73 g m−2 day−1 and 4.066 g m−2 day−1, respectively. The fatty acid profile by means of gas chromatography resulted in seven fatty acids from C12 to C18. The most abundant fatty acid methyl esters (FAMES) were palmitic (C16:0), oleic (C18:1), and stearic (C18:0) acids. Lipid synthesis enhanced by optimizing the Kuhl growth medium with replacing nitrate by urea (50% N compared to the original recipe) increased salt content (10 g/l NaCl), ferrous sulfate (0.5 g/l), and sodium acetate addition (1 g/l). With regard to density, kinematic viscosity, gravity, pour point, flash point, and cetane number, the Chlorella-biodiesel comply with ASTM and EN standards thus pointing at the high potential of lipids synthesized by Chlorella as a feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Waste cooking oil (WCO) is one of the most promising feedstocks for biodiesel production as it is environment friendly, has energy supply potential, impacts edible oil safety, and enables competitive recycling costs. However, one central roadblock to the development of WCO-based biodiesel in China is its fairly low collection rate in the formal WCO supply chain. Most waste cooking oil is still collected by informal collectors with some flowing back to “table.” The aim of our paper is to identify the most effective incentive conditions and targets in the WCO supply chain to offer recommendations that address this WCO roadblock. Accordingly, we designed a Stackelberg game model among restaurants, recyclers, and biodiesel production enterprises. The results show that restaurants are the best targets for incentives in this WCO supply chain. With a certain amount of monetary incentives, the WCO supply for biofuel production can be improved significantly. If the restaurant subsidy is 4000 yuan/ton, the amount of WCO recycled would increase by 47%, which is far more efficient than incenting recyclers or biofuel producers. We also set up four scenarios and found that compared with a single policy approach (mandatory only or economic incentive only), a combined policy (mandatory with economic incentive) would be the most effective means to incent restaurants to submit WCO for biofuel. There was also a correlation between policy incentive effectiveness and restaurant sensitivity to WCO submission profits. When the price sensitivity was larger than 17.98, the best policy for the government would be to offer economic incentives to restaurants. To guarantee the effectiveness of such policy incentives, supporting laws, policy guidelines, and routine supervision should be provided as well. © 2019, The Joint Center on Global Change and Earth System Science of the University of Maryland and Beijing Normal University.

AB  - This work examines the feasibility of fuelling biodiesel derived from Eichhornia crassipes in a compression ignition engine. This work also proposes water hyacinth biodiesel (WHB) as a potential alternative energy source since the above species is available extensively in freshwater, marine, and aquatic ecosystems throughout the world. WHB was blended with petroleum diesel fuel at various volume proportions of 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 100% and their properties were analyzed as per ASTM standards for its application as biofuel. The prepared test fuels were analyzed experimentally in a single-cylinder diesel engine at constant speed (1500 rev/min) for its performance, combustion, and emission characteristics. Test results projected that the characteristics of 20% WHB + 80% diesel fuel blend were in par with neat diesel fuel in terms of thermal efficiency, HC, CO, and smoke emissions. However, WHB blends resulted in slightly higher levels of CO2 and NOx emissions. At full load, the attained cylinder pressure and heat release rate of WHB were comparatively lower than diesel fuel. Ignition delay is lowest for B100 blend and therefore the diffusion burning phase of biodiesel phase is found to be dominant in comparison with diesel fuel. For biodiesel blends, the combustion starts earlier due to higher cetane number, lessened delay period, and lowered calorific value followed by lowered HRR.

AB  - This manuscript describes the research and development undertaken at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory subsequent to an earlier bio-oil hydrotreating historical development review in 2007. It also includes the implications for future development needs related to hydroprocessing of biomass fast pyrolysis bio-oil for liquid hydrocarbon fuels production. The results of the research, the needs and implications for additional research and development, as well as the future potential for technology transfer to industrial application are included. The progress over the 10 years of research can be captured by the technoeconomic assessment in the reduction in cost of the product by nearly 80% of the starting assessment. Design catalyst lifetime was extended from <10 days to half a year through improvements in operational details such as catalyst formulations and operating temperatures, with introduction of sulfur guard beds (with regeneration protocols) to protect precious metal catalyst in the low-temperature stabilization bed, as well as the recycle of the heavy ends of the hydrotreated product back to the hydrotreater for product finishing. Attempted operation of an ebullated bed reactor system was unsuccessful but enlightening as to the complex phase structure experienced in bio-oil hydrotreating. © 2019

AB  - Bio-mix is a fuel derived from the raw mixture of different non-edible oils to enhance the saturation level. In this study, raw oil mixture was transesterified to form bio-mix methyl ester (BMME). Fuel properties of BMME was measured and results showed that saturated fatty acids (SFA), cetane number (CN), and oxidation stability (OS) were increased, whereas density, viscosity, HHV, flash point, iodine number, and acid number were decreased for BMME as compared to individual biodiesels. Brake specific energy consumption (BSEC) of BMME was higher than diesel fuel but similar to individual biodiesel, while brake thermal efficiency (BTE) was lower than diesel fuel but higher than the individual biodiesel. (NOx) and CO2 emission of BMME was found lower (approximately 20%); meanwhile, smoke opacity and CO emission biodiesel increased compared to diesel fuel, whereas (HC) emission of BMME was lower at low load condition but it is increased at high load. Bio-mix fuel could be the good replacement of diesel fuel. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - With deteriorating energy reserves, rising environmental apprehensions and progressively more firm energy regulations have made renewable energy resources as an extremely attractive alternative source for near future. Biodiesel was considered as one of the promising energy resource for diesel engines. In the present work, non-edible oils namely pumpkin seed oil and Moringa oleifera oil were converted into methyl ester of Pumpkin seed oil (B1) and Moringa oleifera oil (B2) using transesterification process. The engine modification technique was said to be one of the current development in the field of the engine research motivating to achieve complete combustion. Two novel bowl geometries namely Toroidal Combustion Chamber (TCC) and Trapezoidal Combustion Chamber (TRCC) were developed and compared with standard Hemispherical Combustion Chamber (HCC). Further, the work was progressed to exergy and energy analysis. Amongst the bowl geometries, TCC showed better engine characteristics than TRCC and HCC. High swirl and squish behaviour of TCC engine helps in better air-fuel mixing and leads to complete combustion. Biodiesel samples contain oxygen molecules in its structure, reduced engine exhaust emissions except NOx were observed. On the whole, B1 may be considered as the promising alternative fuel as it exhibited 66.51% of exergy efficiency in TCC engine. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Modern gas turbines are a significant source for power generation and prime mover for marine propulsion. The depleting fossil fuel sources have provided a cue for broader implementation and usage of renewable energy. Biofuel has been touted as a substitute for natural gas to power gas turbines. To confirm the dependability and reliability of this attempt in a complex multi-domain system, for example, the gas turbine, the fuel system of the micro-gas turbine is designed and modelled using MATLAB Simulink. The model; simulates the; transient and steady state of a gas turbine’s nominal functional situations. Evaluations between the field data and; simulation outcomes validate a high degree of correspondence. The fuel system in the micro;-gas turbine simulation model is also optimized with the experimental data. © 2019 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.

AB  - The current investigation has been aimed at the effective utilization of the alternative renewable feedstock towards propelling the diesel engine. A novel alternative feedstock, which is abundantly present in the south of India, Mimusops elengi was identified for this present investigation. The study was initiated with 20% of Mimusops elengi and methyl ester (B20) was blended with fossil diesel fuel on a volume basis. Moreover, it was observed that on the trade-off between the performance characteristics; the emission quantity was marginally higher. Concentrating on the environmental pollution caused by the diesel engine, an oxygenated nano additive, titanium oxide, was doped with the base fuel at different mass fractions of 25, 50, 75, and 100 parts per million (ppm). The result observed states that B20 with 25 ppm of titanium oxide nanoparticle (B20 + 25 ppm) established a 3.60% improvement in BTE (brake thermal efficiency) as equated with B20; furthermore, it resulted in 14.2% and 17.4% reduction in hydrocarbon and smoke emission, respectively, though it resulted in a marginal penalty of 14.72% in NOx. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Waste-to-energy (WTE) technologies provide opportunities to use waste materials beneficially in producing power, transportation fuels, and chemicals. Using a suite of economic models, this study estimates prices of four WTE resources: food waste; fats, oils, and greases (FOG); animal manure; and sewage sludge. Some of these materials are commoditized (e.g. FOG) thus their price is determined by market demand. For the materials regarded as waste, the study relates price to the avoided cost of disposal through waste management alternatives such as landfilling. This study finds that significant amounts of these feedstocks could be available at negative prices, meaning that a potential bioenergy facility could receive these materials for free or be paid to accept them in some locations. It is estimated that about 61% of sewage sludge, 27% of manure, and 7% of food waste may be available at negative prices. These negative price feedstocks are not uniformly distributed and are most likely to occur in areas with organic waste disposal bans, high population densities, and high landfill tipping fees. This study intends to open an initial discussion into how stakeholders view and value these materials, and how this view is evolving as their potential as WTE feedstocks is realized. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microwave pyrolysis has become an attractive form of processing technology to generate bio-oil, bio-char and syngas from different biomass feedstocks. In this study, microwave pyrolysis was performed on the UK native seaweed Laminaria digitata and its extract residue from a bio-refinery process. Pyrolysis of these two feedstocks was successfully achieved without the requirement of microwave susceptors, as pelletizing the biomass was sufficient to allow microwave pyrolysis to occur. It was found that average energy requirements as low as 1.84–2.83 kJ g−1 were required to pyrolyse 55–70% of both feedstocks and bio-oil yields of 5–8% and 10–14% for native and extraction residue L. digitata were produced, respectively. Maximum microwave pyrolysis processing times were in the order of 200 s. The bio-oil generated from both feedstocks contained no phenolic based compounds, but a greater number of nitrogen-containing compounds and compounds derived from macroalgal polysaccharides. Yields of certain compounds differed in bio-oils generated from the two L. digitata feedstocks, however it was observed that specific energy did not have a direct influence on bio-oil compound yield. Furthermore, the identification of a particular nitrogen-containing compound L-Proline, 1-methyl-5-oxo-, methylester is thought to be a unique product of microwave pyrolysis when carbon-based additives are avoided. © 2019

AB  - Two sugarcane biofuels and mineral diesel fuel are tested under full load conditions, under the same values of performance and under the European Transient Cycle on an engine test bench, without any modifications to the ECU. The target is to compare engine performance and emissions. At full load, engine performance varies due to the variation in LHV. Under the same values of performance, the sugarcane biodiesel-LS9 provides the lowest THC emissions. The higher CN and exhaust gas recirculation of the sugarcane biodiesel-LS9 and the higher H/C ratio of the sugarcane diesel-farnesane compared to the diesel S50 provide a NOx reduction. Neither the increment in bsfc nor the increment of %EGR for the sugarcane biodiesel-LS9 deteriorate the combustion, so its CO emissions are lower. The sugarcane biodiesel-LS9 leads to the lowest NOx and PM specific emissions under transient operation, followed by the sugarcane diesel-farnesane. The THC and CO specific emissions are higher for the biofuels in comparison to the diesel S50. The main reason for these results is the impact of the properties of the biofuels on the ECU response However, both biofuels produce less harmful emissions at idle conditions, which supports their usage to reduce exhaust emissions in urban areas. © 2019

AB  - The main aim of this work was to assess a conceptual strategy of submerged pelletized growth of Mucor circinelloides in sugarcane vinasse under different conditions aiming at the production of lipids prone to be used in biodiesel syntheses. Industrial vinasse was characterized and then tested in its raw form as culture medium. Relatively high concentrations of lipids were observed (approximately 23%), and biomass accumulation can be enhanced by the addition of corn steep liquor (approximately 5-fold increase when compared to control). Phenolic compounds present in vinasse pose inhibitory effects in biomass and lipid accumulation. The pelletized hyphae then proceeded to a simple sieve separation, on which lipids were extracted in a microwave extraction system, with a resulting fatty acid profile that indicate a potential suitable feedstock for biodiesel production due to the balance of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - It is very important for the diesel engine to achieve a cold startup at low environmental temperature especially in the region with the temperature in the range of −40 °C to 0 °C. Thus, the specific cold start characteristics, such as gas leakage, heat loss and clearance volume, should be investigated in detail. In order to investigate the cold start ability, an improved thermodynamic model for thermodynamic parameters is developed. The prediction of ignition temperature is the closest to the experimental values when the adiabatic index is equal to 1.34 for the compressed gas. The thermodynamic results show that the compression pressure is the most sensitive to the gas leakage rate, followed by the heat transfer loss rate and reference clearance volume. The gas leakage, heat loss and clearance volume are employed to investigate the cold start ability for the diesel engine, which provide a better reference for strengthening the cold start capacity research. The small clearance volume and big initial intake air temperature can improve the exergy of diesel engine. In addition, the entropy production increases with the increase of clearance volume. Similarly, the exergy of system will reduce with the increase of entropy production. Finally, the improvement suggestions for cold starting performance enhancement of the diesel engine are proposed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Soil contamination with petroleum has long been a major environmental problem. Many methods have been developed for its remediation, including bioremediation, one of the most applied procedures. The biodegradation rate of bioremediation depends on the soil environment and can be enhanced by microorganism immobilization. Here, a modified biofuel ash was proposed as a new highly efficient and inexpensive immobilization carrier and tested experimentally in soil systems. Results: The degradation rate of petroleum hydrocarbon in soil by inoculated microorganisms immobilized on humic acid-modified biofuel ash reached up to 47.8% during 60 days, which was twice as high as that by free microorganisms. In treatments with immobilized microbes, n-alkanes with C28 and C31–34 were not detected and the degradation rates of C17–19 were 70.6% (unsterilized soil) and 54.2% (sterilized soil). The change in enzymatic activity reflected the basic respiration rate: it gradually increased in the pre-remediation stage, then decreased, and finally stabilized. Microorganism immobilization carriers had no significant contribution to microbial diversity in unsterilized soil, but they increased in sterilized soil. Conclusions: Humic acid-modified biofuel ash inoculated with microorganisms improves the degradability of petroleum and biodiversity in soil without microbes and, through the application of biofuel ash, reuses power plant waste. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Rwandan dependence on imported petroleum products led to the exploration of the possibility of using biodiesel. To obtain feedstock, local farmers across the country were encouraged to grow Jatropha curcas L for biodiesel production project. This study investigated the economic feasibility of small-scale Jatropha farming for biodiesel production in Kirehe district, Eastern Province. In assessing the economic feasibility, both primary and secondary data were used. Primary data were collected from a total of 73 small-scale Jatropha farmers in five selected sectors in Kirehe district as well as from interviews with key players of biodiesel project. By using Net Present Value (NPV) and Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR) as cost-benefit indicators, it was found that currently Jatropha cultivation is not economically feasible. This is due to very low seed yields, low Jatropha seed price, high discount rate and high production cost. Sensitivity analysis indicated that Jatropha cultivation is economically viable when seed yield is greater than 7000 kg/ha/year (with NPV greater than 1,184,414 Rwf/ha) and seed market price is greater than 240 Rwf/kg (with NPV greater than 88,172 Rwf/ha). In addition, it was found that if Jatropha is grown as fences (which require less inputs and labour), the venture is profitable with NPV of 821,500 Rwf/ha. However, substantial amount of revenue (2,081,924 Rwf/ha) is generated when hired labour is replaced by family labour. Based on the findings from this study, it is recommended that currently small-scale farmers should grow Jatropha as fences around their farms or alongside roads due to significantly low investment risks and opportunity costs for land. However, higher profit will be realized from Jatropha grown as fences if alternative uses of seeds will be developed by various actors along the value chain. © 2019 International Energy Initiative

AB  - Size-resolved elemental measurements were conducted for the water-soluble fraction of particulate matter at a central California coastal city, Marina, during two separate summertime field campaigns: the Nucleation in California Experiment (NiCE) in 2013 and the Fog and Stratocumulus Evolution (FASE) campaign in 2016. Two Micro-Orifice Uniform Deposit Impactors (MOUDIs) were used to quantify mass size distributions of 29 elements and a Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model revealed six characteristic sources during the measurement periods: (i) Crustal Emissions (3.9% of total mass), (ii) Secondary Aerosol (24.4%), (iii) Biomass Burning (13.1%), (iv) Waste Facilities (8.7%), (v) Vehicular Emissions (4.4%), and (vi) Marine Emissions (45.4%). Characteristic elements from each of these sources included the following: (i) Crustal Emissions (Fe, Al, Ti, Pt), (ii) Secondary Aerosol (Zn, As, Rb, K, Cu, V), (iii) Biomass Burning (Rb, K, Cu, Pt), (iv) Waste Facilities (Ag, Cd, Ni, Al), (v) Vehicular Emissions (Zn, Zr, V, Mn), and (vi) Marine Emissions (Na, Sr, V, Mn). Temporally-resolved results revealed higher PM levels associated with Vehicular Emissions (day/night mass concentration ratio = 31.3), Crustal Emissions (day/night = 20.0), and Secondary Aerosol (day/night = 27.2) during the day compared to night due to some combination of more daytime anthropogenic activity, wind speed/directional factors, and photochemistry. The Marine Emissions factor exhibited a day/night concentration ratio of exactly 1.0. Mass size distributions revealed characteristic peaks in four diameter ranges: 0.1–0.18 μm, 0.32–0.56 μm, 1.0–1.8 μm, and 3.2–5.6 μm. The number of modes varied depending on the species and degree of wildfire influence, with additional differences observed between the NiCE and FASE wildfire periods. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Upgrading biochemicals to the high energy density intermediates is the promising way to produce renewable diesel and jet fuel range alkanes. In this work, K2O clusters containing N-doped microporous and mesoporous carbon materials were prepared by a one-pot method and used as base catalysts to produce the key biofuel intermediate derived from furfural through its solvent-free aldol condensation with acetone. It is found that K2O clusters, which are stabilized by nitrogen and carbon atoms of N-doped porous carbon materials due to their strong interactions, are located inside the micropores, existing in the form of extra framework K2O clusters. The presence of K2O clusters inside micropores endows N-doped microporous and mesoporous carbon catalysts exceptional catalytic activity and shape selectivity in aldol condensation, almost full furfural conversion and over 90% selectivity to the monomer aldol product 4-(2-furyl)-3-buten-2-one (FAc) can be achieved within 2 h reaction time at 100 °C over these two types of N-doped carbon catalysts, which can be attributed to the synergetic effect between strong basic K2O clusters and N-doped carbon materials, and the micropores, which hinder the second condensation step to form the dimer aldol product 1, 5-di-2-furanyl-1, 4-pentadien-3-one (F2Ac). In addition, all the catalysts exhibited excellent regeneration capability and their catalytic activities can be well recovered by calcination under N2. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The global demand for biofuels in the transport sector may lead to significant biodiversity impacts via multiple human pressures. Biodiversity assessments of biofuels, however, seldom simultaneously address several impact pathways, which can lead to biased comparisons with fossil fuels. The goal of the present study was to quantify the direct influence of habitat loss, water consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on potential global species richness loss due to the current production of first-generation biodiesel from soybean and rapeseed and bioethanol from sugarcane and corn. We found that the global relative species loss due to biofuel production exceeded that of fossil petrol and diesel production in more than 90% of the locations considered. Habitat loss was the dominating stressor with Chinese corn, Brazilian soybean and Brazilian sugarcane having a particularly large biodiversity impact. Spatial variation within countries was high, with 90th percentiles differing by a factor of 9 to 22 between locations. We conclude that displacing fossil fuels with first-generation biofuels will likely negatively affect global biodiversity, no matter which feedstock is used or where it is produced. Environmental policy may therefore focus on the introduction of other renewable options in the transport sector. © 2019 The Authors. GCB Bioenergy Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - In the present work, Ulva lactuca, a marine macroalgae was used for the production of biodiesel. The ultrasound assisted extraction of oil from autoclaved algal biomass was found effective with maximum yield. The maximum oil was extracted at optimal conditions of 5% moisture content of algal biomass, 0.15 mm size of biomass, 6:1 solvent: solid ratio, at 55 °C in 140 min. The n-hexane with co-solvent methyl tertbutyl ether has shown higher oil when compared to other co-solvents. The extracted oil was transesterified into biodiesel using silica doped with zinc oxide as novel heterogeneous nanocatalyst. The maximum biodiesel yield of 97.43% was obtained at optimized conditions of 800 °C calcination temperature, 8% catalyst concentration, 9:1 methanol to oil ratio, 55 °C reaction temperature and 50 min reaction time. The kinetics of the transesterification reaction was also studied. The Ulva lactuca was found as a potential source for biodiesel production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Polyoxymethylene dimethyl ethers (PODEn with n = 3–8) is a new biofuel that has a great potential to become one of the competitive alternative fuels for diesel engine. It also plays a crucial role in expansion of C1 chemical industry. Because PODE6–8 tends to precipitate in PODE3–8/diesel blends at low temperatures, it is very important to increase the selectivity to PODE3,4 and to decrease the selectivity to PODE6–8. Here a series of Lewis acids were used for the first time as catalyst to synthesize PODEn from methylal and trioxane. For the investigated Lewis acids, MgCl2 yielded the greatest selectivity to PODE3,4 and the smallest selectivity to PODE5–8. Similar selectivity to PODE3,4 and much lower selectivity to PODE5–8 can be achieved by using optimized reaction time and using MgCl2 in place of the traditional catalyst H2SO4 and ionic liquids catalysts [NOP][TFO] (1-octyl-2-pyrrolidinonium trifluoromethanesulfonate) and [NOP][DNBSA] (1-octyl-2-pyrrolidinonium 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonate) as catalyst. In addition, these Lewis acids have many advantages over the traditional catalysts and ionic liquids catalysts, including low corrosiveness, high separability, and low cost. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Drop-in biofuels are non-oxygenated biofuels composed by biohydrocarbons produced from different biomass. These drop-in biofuels (biogasoline, bio jet-fuel and green diesel) show a great importance due to their properties similar to those observed for fossil fuels. Lipids are one of the most important raw material used for deoxygenation reactions over special catalysts. In this work, niobium phosphate was investigated as catalyst in the production of drop-in biofuels from soybean oil, using mild experimental conditions. The performance of niobium phosphate was evaluated under different reaction time (3–5 h), catalyst amount (0–25%) and temperature (300–350 °C), using 10 bar H2. The composition of the liquid products was determined by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, and characterized by infrared spectroscopy. The optimization process led to high yields of hydrocarbons in the range of C9–C17. About 62% of bio-jet fuel, 40% of green diesel, and 18% of gasoline range hydrocarbons were obtained in a single reaction step. Their composition included mainly linear and branched alkanes as well as aromatics compounds. The pathways for the involved reactions are discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To improve jet biofuel quality with increased iso-alkane content, a bi-functional catalyst with strong acidity was proposed to promote hydrodeoxygenation and hydrocracking of microalgae biodiesel through loading heteropoly acid H3PW12O40 (HPW) on Ni-based hierarchical mesoporous zeolite Y (meso-Y). It was found by quantum chemistry calculation that hydrodeoxygenation process of microalgae biodiesel was inclined to the decarboxylation pathway other than the decarbonylation pathway, because the total enthalpy of pentadecane and byproducts obtained through decarboxylation of methyl palmitate (C16:0) was lower by 187.7 kJ/mol than that through decarbonylation. The selectivities of hydrocracking products with odd carbons (2n − 1, n = 5, 6, 7, 8) were higher than those with even carbons (2n), because the covalent bonds hydrocracked to remove even carbons were 0.001–0.149% longer in bond length and 0.012–1.697% lower in bond order than those hydrocracked to remove odd carbons. The experimental results of hydrodeoxygenation and hydrocracking conversion of microalgae biodiesel into jet biofuel carried out in a fixed bed reaction system agreed well with the quantum chemistry calculation results. The BET surface area of 10% Ni/meso-Y catalyst loaded with 4% HPW decreased by 14.3% to 453.9 m2/g, but its strong acid density increased by 30.6% to 1.62 mmol/g. Accordingly, the selectivity of jet biofuel in liquid products converted from microalgae biodiesel at 255 °C and 2 MPa hydrogen increased to 63.1%, in which iso-alkane selectivity markedly increased to 20.5% and arene selectivity was reasonable at 11.1%. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In internal combustion engines, mineral engine oils which serve as lubricants between parts are not used alone due to technical reasons and various additives are made use of for better lubrication. In these additives, liquid boron serves to reduce friction. To reduce the environmental damage caused by engine lubrication oils, it is necessary to improve the properties of biological oils so that they can be used and compete with mineral oils technically. In the study, the use of liquid boron as an engine lubrication oil additive, together with wild mustard oil methyl ester, was investigated. Two diesel engines with the same characteristics were used. In the first engine, experiments were carried out using mineral lubrication oil, then the experiments were repeated using mineral oil with additives, and the results were compared for both situations. The study was conducted mainly in the fields of element analysis of endoscopic examination and lubricating oil (Al, Fe, Cu, Pb, Cr). As a result, it was found out that the engine in which mineral lubricating oil with boron and wild mustard oil methyl ester additive was used did not pose any risks in terms of wear and engine oil life, compared to the engine without additive lubricating oil. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Introduction: Diesel emissions have a high level of particulate matter which can cause inflammation and oxidative stress in the airways. A strategy to reduce diesel particulate matter and the associated adverse effects is the use of biodiesels and fuel additives. However, very little is known about the biological effects of these alternative emissions. The aim of this study is to compare the effect of biodiesel and triacetin/biodiesel emissions on primary human bronchial epithelial cells (pHBECs) compared to diesel emissions. Methods: pHBECs were exposed to diesel, biodiesel (20%, 50% and 100% biodiesel derived from coconut oil) and triacetin/biodiesel (4% and 10% triacetin) emissions for 30 min at air-liquid interface. Cell viability (cellular metabolism, cell death, CASP3 mRNA expression and BCL2 mRNA expression), inflammation (IL-8 and IL-6 secretion), antioxidant production (HO-1 mRNA expression) and xenobiotic metabolism (CYP1a1 mRNA expression) were measured. Results: Biodiesel emissions (B50) reduced cell viability, and increased oxidative stress. Triacetin/biodiesel emissions (B90) decreased cell viability and increased antioxidant production, inflammation and xenobiotic metabolism. Biodiesel emissions (B100) reduced cell viability, and increased IL-8 secretion and xenobiotic metabolism. Conclusions: Biodiesel substitution in diesel fuel and triacetin substitution in biodiesel can increase the adverse effects of diesel emissions of pHBECs. Further studies of the effect of these diesel fuel alternatives on pHBECs are required. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The conversion of karanja fruit hulls by fast pyrolysis was investigated using a drop-type two-stage reactor. The ex-situ catalytic fast pyrolysis of karanja fruit hulls over a silica-alumina catalyst was performed at 500 °C and at a catalyst loading of 0.1 g. The obtained bio-oil yield was 41.09 wt%. The bio-oil contained 84.38% carbonyls. The silica-alumina catalyst reduced the liquid yield to 39.73 wt%. The production of aromatics and hydrocarbons in bio-oil was enhanced, whereas the yield of carbonyls was reduced from 84.38% (non-catalytic) to 7.83% (catalytic). After catalyst regeneration, the aromatic yield was increased from 30.08% (1st run) to 52.18% (5th run), and the deoxygenation degree was increased from 35.15% (1st run) to 57.13% (5th run), thereby demonstrating that the silica-alumina catalyst had satisfactory reusability. The amount of catalytic coke was reduced after catalyst regeneration, because less hard coke was formed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lewis acid-catalyzed in situ transesterification/esterification of tigernut (Cyperus esculentus) was conducted in sub/supercritical ethanol. An L16 (44) orthogonal design with four factors at four levels was employed to investigate the influence of the process variables on the product distribution and the composition of crude biodiesel (CBD). The four factors were temperature (230–290 °C), time (0–90 min), ethanol to feedstock ratio (E/F) (4/3–16/3 mL/g), and catalyst type (ZnCl2, FeCl3, SnCl2, and H3PO4). The results showed that the catalyst type and E/F ratio were the two most influential variables affecting the yield and composition of the CBD. Of the Lewis acids tested, SnCl2 showed the highest performance in terms of the CBD yield and its esters content. Increasing the E/F ratio essentially led to a higher CBD yield and higher ester content of the CBD. A higher temperature and longer reaction time resulted in an obvious increase in the gas yield but had no significant effect on the yield and quality of the CBD. The produced CBDs had extremely low N and S contents (0.2–0.6 wt% and less than 0.1 wt%, respectively) and were abundant in fatty acid esters (∼70%), mainly ethyl oleate and ethyl palmitate, making it more suitable for subsequent biofuel production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Emulsification is an economic route for the applications of pyrolysis bio-oil in diesel engines and industrial furnaces and heating. The oxidative reaction interaction of a number of bio-oil/diesel emulsified fuels at various bio-oil contents and bio-oil-to-emulsifier weight ratios (i.e. B/E ratios) is analyzed to provide a basis for the applications of pyrolysis bio-oil. The commercial Atlox 4914 is used as the surfactant, while a thermogravimetric analyzer is employed in the analysis. The interaction phenomena are obviously observed during the oxidative reaction of the emulsified fuels. The interaction can be partitioned into a weak antagonistic zone (≤210 °C) and a significant synergistic zone (≥210 °C). In the synergistic zone, the oxidation of the fuels is enhanced and the maximum interaction occurs at about 380 °C. A dimensionless parameter termed the synergistic index (SI) is introduced to measure the interaction degree. An increase in the bio-oil content intensifies the interaction up to around 11%, whereas increasing the B/E ratio lowers the SI value. Meanwhile, an opposite trend in the fuel reactivity and burnout temperature is exhibited. The obtained results are able to provide a strategy for the preparation of bio-oil/diesel emulsified fuels to intensify their fuel reactivity and applications in industry. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Jatropha (Jatropha curcas L) seed contains non-edible oil, which is suitable for biodiesel production. The present research focused on the mathematical modelling of the drying kinetics of Jatropha seeds at a storage moisture content. The non-pretreated seeds (whole seeds) and pretreated seeds (crushed seeds) were dried at five different air temperatures (313, 323, 333, 343 and 353 K) in a standard heating furnace. The moisture loss from the seeds was systematically recorded, converted to moisture ratio, and fitted to four semi-theoretical drying mathematical models: Lewis, Henderson and Pabis, Page and Avhad and Marchetti models. The fitness of the models were compared using the coefficient of determination (R 2 ), chi-square test (X 2 ), root mean square error (R MSE ), mean bias error (MBE), and mean absolute error (MAE). It was found that an increase in the air temperature caused a reduction in the drying time of both the whole and crushed seeds. From the tested models, the Avhad and Marchetti model showed the best fitting to the experimental data with R 2 varied from 0.9914 to 0.9969 and 0.9908 to 0.9917 for all tested temperatures for the whole seeds and crushed sees of Jatropha, respectively. The Avhad and Marchetti mode showed superior fit to the experimental data at the drying temperature of 313 K with R 2 of 0.9969 for the whole seed, and at 333 K in case of crushed seeds for which the R 2 value was 0.9917. The activation energy values of 33.53 and 32.885 KJ mol −1 were obtained for the whole and crushed seeds, respectively when the best-fitted model was used. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Flocculation is an effective technique for harvesting microalgae due to low energy input and being scalable up to industrial algaculture. In this study, four different flocculants at various concentration, and pH levels were employed for the harvesting of Chlorella sp. HS2. Among the tested flocculants, chitosan showed the highest flocculation efficiency of 99.6% ± 0.25 at 10 mg L−1 dosage, pH 8.0 and 30 min of sedimentation. It turned out that the choice of flocculants had minimum impact on the fatty acids methyl ester (FAME) yield and composition. When the reusability of the spent medium for each flocculant was investigated, the culture supernatant obtained from chitosan-based harvesting method had lower growth inhibitory effects in comparison to those harvested using the other flocculants. The cost analysis also favored chitosan-based flocculation, because it returned the highest flocculant efficiency while the flocculant dosage was the lowest. Due to its high harvest efficiency and low impact on the water footprint, it was concluded that the chitosan offer promising advantages over other flocculants. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A low-level secretion of hydrolase and low conversion efficiency represent two major challenges in production of second-generation bioethanol. In the study, the co-cultivation system of Penicillium oxalicum 16 and Trichoderma reesei RUT-C30 optimized by response surface methodology under solid state fermentation produced 38.0 IU/gds, 352.9 IU/gds, 713.2 IU/gds, 15.7 IU/gds and 188.6 IU/gds for FPase, xylanase, amylase, cellobiohydrolase and β-1, 4-glucosidase, respectively, which was corresponding to 4.2 fold, 2.9 fold, 2.03 fold, 1.08 fold and 1.96 fold higher than that without optimization. Moreover, unpretreated wheat bran which was hydrolyzed by the optimized co-cultivation system and fermented by Saccharomyces cerevisiae UV-20 was converted into 26.8 g/L ethanol corresponding to 98.41% of the conversion rate, and produced much more ethanol than milled rice straw. The study provided a feasible method which can enhance hydrolase yield and very efficiently produce second-generation bioethanol. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - More than 95% of biodiesel production feedstocks come from edible oils, however it may cause some problems such as the competition of land use between food production and biodiesel production. The waste cooking oils (WCO) are an alternative feedstock for biodiesel production; its usage reduces significantly the cost of biodiesel production and has environmental benefits, e.g., a waste recovery instead of its elimination. This work aims to produce a low-cost efficient solid catalyst for fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) production using mixtures of refined palm oil (RPO) and WCO. Four low cost catalysts were prepared (biomass fly ashes, natural dolomite rock, chicken eggshells and polyethylene terephthalate - PET), characterized (by SEM, EDX, XRD, BET, FT-IR and Hammett indicators) and tested regarding their performance in FAME production. The maximum yield of FAME achieved was around 96%wt. for biomass fly ashes catalyst at 60 °C, 9:1 (mol/mol) of methanol to oil mixture, 10%wt. catalyst to oil mixture, over 180 min in batch reactor. The results point out for promising bifunctional catalysts able to achieve also conversion of free fatty acids up to 100% using mixtures of RPO and WCO. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Calcium oxide (CaO) catalyst was prepared using chicken egg shell waste and tested as a catalyst for the production of biodiesel from Chlorella vulgaris biomass. The calcination method was adopted for the synthesis of CaO catalyst. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) image showed that the catalyst had a spherical structure with average particle size of 46.1 ± 2.1 nm, further analysis was carried out using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) adsorption, scanning electron microscopy, elemental analysis, X-ray diffraction and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Transesterification process was conducted by using response surface methodology (RSM) based on central composite design (CCD). The optimum reaction conditions were observed at 70 °C, 10:1 methanol: dry biomass ratio, 1.39% catalyst loading, 3 h reaction time, and 140 rpm stirring rate resulted 92.03% biodiesel yield. The key fuel properties includes; iodine value (88.5 g I2 100/g), cetane number (50.0), cloud point (9.2 °C), pour point (3.1 °C), oxidation stability (7.4 h), higher heating value (44.7), kinematic viscosity (4.5 mm2/s) and density (0.9 g/cm3) resulted good quality of microalgae biodiesel. Our research finding shows that the CaO catalyst derived from egg shell waste is an economically potential and eco-friendly catalyst for biodiesel production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Nowadays, in most industrial units, biodiesel is produced through transesterification of edible oil and methanol using homogeneous basic catalysts in stirred-tank reactors. The drawbacks of this method include the high cost of feedstock, long reaction time, high energy consumption, and excessive wastewater production. The present study investigated an alternative process, in which biodiesel was produced from indigenous, inedible Norouzak (Salvia leriifolia) oil in the presence of choline hydroxide (ChOH) as an ionic liquid catalyst in a microchannel reactor. Taking into account catalyst concentration, methanol-to-oil volume ratio, and reaction time as the independent variables, Response Surface Methodology (RSM) with a Box-Behnken experimental design was used to determine the optimal reaction efficiency as the response. An efficiency of 93.36% was predicted by the model for a catalyst concentration of 6.11 wt%, methanol-to-oil volume ratio of 0.37, and reaction time of 12.48 min. By conducting experiments under these conditions, an efficiency of 96.8% was obtained. In comparison with the results of previous studies in which ChOH was used as the transesterification catalyst, employing the microchannel reactor in this study reduced the reaction time to less than 0.1 that of a mechanical stirrer. Moreover, the energy consumption was 32 times lower than that of a mechanical stirrer. The use of ChOH instead of KOH in a microchannel reactor increased efficiency by 1.9–4.9%. Compared to heterogeneous catalysts, ChOH can reduce the catalyst and alcohol consumption by at least 29% and 30%, respectively. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study pertains to glorify the significance of physical and chemical properties of blended diesel fuel with 2nd generation ethanol when applied to compression ignition engine. The assessed fuel properties are density, kinematic viscosity, Cetane number, calorific value, sulfur content and flash point for the prepared blends with respect to fuel quality standards. The results are examined based on present stipulations set for fuel quality rendering Bharat Stage VI standard norms in India. Fuel density and viscosity got slightly decreased with the aggregate of 2nd generation ethanol concentration, at the same time sulfur content also witnessed a similar trend. Cetane number also decreased considerably with the inclusion of 2nd generation ethanol content in diesel fuel. Use of 2nd generation ethanol in diesel fuel will expand markets for agricultural commodities and generate extra revenue from 2nd generation ethanol which is produced from waste residuals of the crops. To achieve stringent emissions regulations and government declarations of increasing biofuel usage can be succeeded by adopting 2nd generation ethanol-blended diesel as a commercial fuel in India. Tested 2nd generation ethanol-blended diesel fuel displayed comparable properties values to those of pure diesel fuel. All verified properties were within the standard limits of diesel fuel. It includes an incisive discussion on the feasible effects of fuel property variation with 2nd generation ethanol-blended diesel fuel concentration. The extreme concentration of 2nd generation ethanol in diesel fuel that can meet the essential characteristics within the range for diesel engine application has been being assessed here. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the present study, the noise pollution from different compositions of biodiesel, bioethanol, and diesel fuels in MF285 Tractor was studied in the second and third gears from two positions: driver and bystander, at 1000 and 1600 r/min, and running on 10 different fuel levels. For data analysis, the ANFIS network, neural network, and response surface methodology were applied. Comparing the means of noise pollution at different levels demonstrated that the B25E6D69 fuel, made up of 25% biodiesel and 6% bioethanol, had the lowest noise pollution. The lowest noise pollution was at 1000 r/min. Although the noise pollution emitted in the third gear was a little more than that emitted in the second gear. All the resultant models, laid by response surface methodology, neural network, and ANFIS had excellent results. Considering the statistical criteria, the best models with high correlation coefficients and low mean square errors were ANFIS, response surface methodology, and artificial neural network models, respectively. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - European Union legislation in the form of the Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC and the Deployment of Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Directive 2014/94/EC have placed mandatory requirements on Member States to deliver sustainable forms of alternative transport infrastructure in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector. However, there is currently little or no refuelling infrastructure to support the development of an alternative transport fuel market for compressed natural gas and its renewable form biomethane in a number of EU Member States. Primarily focussing on a combination of biomethane and compressed natural gas (bio-CNG), this paper analyses the key considerations to develop a strategic infrastructure framework for bio-CNG and defines the criteria for the placement of public access refuelling stations in order to satisfy legislative requirements, commercial considerations, strategic placement and natural gas network infrastructure utilisation. This paper devises a strategic infrastructure framework on which a national public access refuelling network for bio-CNG could be provided for Ireland as a template and for other Member States with similar infrastructure and renewable requirements to follow. The framework includes the provision of 22 bio-CNG refuelling installations in strategic locations across the country. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, a study of the effects of Moringa Oil Biodiesel (MOB) biodiesel-diesel blends on the engine's performance, exhaust particulate matter, gaseous emissions and combustion characteristics was carried out in a multi-cylinder high-pressure common-rail diesel engine. The experiment involved the use of baseline diesel and several MOB blends (MOB10, MOB20, MOB30 and MOB50) as the fuel for the diesel engine. The results concluded that the engine torques and brake power produced by all of the MOB blends is smaller to the baseline diesel. However, both the MOB blends and baseline diesel produced similar brake thermal efficiency (BTE). It is noticed that the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) of all MOB are indicating deterioration, but showing an improvement in the brake specific energy consumption (BSEC). Besides, the peak cylinder pressure and peak HRR indicated a trend of declination with the increasing biodiesel blend ratio. Furthermore, all MOB has shown a great improvement in the emission of carbon monoxide (CO), smoke and particulate matter (PM), except nitrogen oxides (NOx). In short, Moringa oil is suitable to use as a source of biodiesel fuel in the diesel engines without any engine modification needs to be done. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Experimental tests on an Euro III compression ignition engine were performed with blends of diesel B15 fuel with ethanol (0–20 vol%) and 1 vol% of an original additive, defined as a mixture of 72.5 vol% of castor oil, 17.5 vol% of soybean biodiesel and 10 vol% of n-butanol. Such mixtures were compared to commercial diesel B7 E0 fuel. The results showed that the addition of ethanol implied an increase of the ignition delay, a faster heat release and a decrease of maximum pressure. Without any optimization of injection timing and combustion, results showed a better conversion of ethanol chemical energy into brake power, when compared with a commercial flex fuel spark ignition engine. In addition, a small increase in the indicated efficiency, in particular at low loads (25% of the maximum torque obtained with commercial fuel under the same rotation), was also observed. Specific fuel consumption increased almost 2% for each 5 vol% of anhydrous ethanol in the blends since the density and the lower heating value of the fuel decreased. A significant decrease of maximum torque was also observed, due to a reduction of the injected volume of fuel (up to 30% in diesel B15 E20 fuel). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Advanced third generation biofuels like pyrolysis oil generated from waste biomass paves way for a cleaner and sustainable environment. An experimental-cum-statistical analysis was performed with the aim of determining the optimal engine operating conditions (with respect to compression ratio, load and fuel blend) to enhance the engine operating characteristics (performance and emission) of a diesel engine. Multiple regression models designed by using response surface methodology (RSM) for the output response variables like brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), brake thermal efficiency (BTE), oxides of carbon (CO&amp;CO2), hydrocarbon (HC), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and smoke opacity were found to be statistically significant by analysis of variance. Optimization was carried out using desirability approach with a target of maximizing BTE and CO2 simultaneously by minimizing all other responses. From the results, it can be observed that the optimum conditions for bio-oil operation were 18:1 compression ratio, 20% fuel blend and 100% load. The models developed by RSM were validated through confirmatory experiments and found that the models were satisfactory to report the influence of compression ratio, load and bio-oil concentration on the operating characteristics of the diesel engine as the error in prediction is within 5%. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biomass is a promising source of energy that can be substituted effectively for fossil fuels in many applications. In a developing country like India, people rely heavily on kerosene as a fuel for cooking and heating. Being derived from fossil fuels, kerosene is a finite resource and its cost is likely to increase in the future. Hence, the partial or complete replacement of kerosene is being considered in some jurisdictions. In this context, the use of vegetable based fuel as a substitute for kerosene fuel is explored here. Waste cooking oil and sesame oil are the biofuel feedstocks selected for consideration. Experiments are conducted using blends of vegetable based fuel with kerosene in a wick stove. Performance parameters like thermal efficiency, fuel consumption rate, and flame structure are studied. Parameters for such emissions as NOx, CO and CO2 are analyzed. The results indicate that operation using kerosene is superior in terms of performance but weaker in terms of emissions characteristics. It was observed that a blend with 50% vegetable esters results in significant emissions with only a marginal decrease in performance, suggesting this is an optimal or near optimal blend. Furthermore, of the blends with WCO and sesame oil esters, the 50% blend of sesame oil ester with kerosene exhibits better results. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Oil content from seed kernels of Xanthoceras sorbifolia from 13 areas in China was analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry to determine oil characteristics and biodiesel properties. The seeds had a high kernel percentage (53.67% ± 7.51), oil content (52.21% ± 4.01), and biodiesel yield (99.77% ± 0.21). Among the fatty acids in the oil were high percentages of linoleic acid (41.66 ± 2.26)% and oleic acid (28.44% ± 2.03). Most of the fuel properties complied well with the ASTM D6751-10, EN 14214-08, and GB/T 20828-2014 standards. The 13 sampling areas were grouped into four clusters based on different kernel percentage, oil content, biodiesel yield, and fatty acid composition. The results showed that the quality of kernel oils from seeds from Ar Horqin Banner was the best, although kernel oils from seeds in all 13 areas were suitable for biodiesel production. This study provides a basis for selecting optimal sites to harvest seeds from X. sorbifolia. © 2018, Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Due to the unstable nature of bio-oil, it becomes mandatory to analyze the changes in physical and chemical properties of the bio-oil during storage to appreciate its chemical instability, for developing stabilization strategies. The present study aims to investigate the oxidative and thermal stability of bio-oil extracted from pyrolyzing Calophyllum inophyllum (CI) deoiled seed cake in a fixed bed reactor at 500 °C under the constant heating rate of 30 °C/min. Each stability analysis method involve an accelerated aging procedure based on standards established by ASTM (D5304 and E2009) and European standard (EN 14112). Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry were employed to analytically characterize the un-aged and aged bio-oil samples. The results clearly depict that stabilizing Calophyllum inophyllum bio-oil with 10% (w/w) methanol improved its stability than that of the crude sample. Addition of methanol reduced the change in viscosity of bio-oil by 38.55% during accelerated aging process. The oxidation stability index of bio-oil stabilized with methanol was found to be 3.97 h which is in accordance with ASTM D6751. FT-IR and GC-MS results showed an increase in the relative concentration of C-O (carboxylic acids, ethers and esters) and C=O (carbonyl) functional groups in aged bio-oil samples. © 2018 Energy Institute

AB  - Biofuels have been promoted as a likely avenue for the future transportation energy mix. Hence, production of biofuels using lignocellulosic feedstocks, such as forest-based biomass, is expected to increase globally. Forest biomass abundance and experience with applying biomass conversion technologies gives the Nordic countries an advantage in catering to biofuel production capacity investment. Yet, given uncertainties in the techno-economic variables of biofuel conversion technologies, as well as differences between the Nordic countries in terms of labor costs, bioheat market prices and electricity and forest biomass costs and prices, it is unclear which of the Nordic countries are comparatively attractive for future investment in forest-based biofuel production capacity. In this paper, we quantify how techno-economic cost components of a novel forest-based biofuel production technology affect optimal allocation of biofuel production capacity in the Nordic countries at a regional level. We apply a scenario analysis approach using an endogenous biofuel capacity investment module in the Nordic Forest Sector Model (NFSM). In each scenario, we alter the techno-economic features of the technology and quantify total biofuel production allocation volume in each region and at a national level. We find that optimal capacity allocation is affected by the type of feedstock used in the technology and will affect existing industries dependent on forest feedstocks. Electricity selling or purchasing will have little effect on allocation because it comprises a small revenue or cost proportion. Bioheat may affect allocation, but this will depend on local demand. Finally, labor costs may affect allocation, but this will depend on the labor intensity, which changes with scale. The results are relevant for policy incentives to proliferate future forest-based biofuel production in the Nordic countries. © 2017

AB  - The aim of this study is to find an optimal design for a distributed hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) for a residential house in the UK. The hybrid system, which consists of wind turbines, PV arrays, a bio-diesel generator, batteries and converters, is designed to meet the known dynamic electrical load of the house and make use of renewable energy resources available locally. Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables (HOMER) software is used for this study. Different combinations of wind turbines, PV arrays, a biodiesel generator and batteries are evaluated and compared using the NPC (Net Present Cost) method to find the optimal solutions. The HRES is modeled, simulated and optimized using HOMER. The results showed that the wind-biodiesel en-gine-battery system was the best with the lowest NPC (USD 60254) and the lowest COE (Cost of Energy, USD 0.548/kWh) while the second best system added PV arrays. This study gives evidence of the key contribution wind turbines make to HRES due to abundant wind resources in the UK, especially in Wales. © 2019, Editorial office of Journal of Resources and Ecology.

AB  - A series of 5-(alkoxymethyl)furfurals (AMFs) have been synthesized in excellent isolated yields (>90%) by reacting biomass-derived 5-(chloromethyl)furfural (CMF) or 5-(bromomethyl)furfural (BMF) with monohydric alkyl alcohols (methanol to 1-butanol) at slightly elevated temperatures (RT-50 °C) and short reaction time (3 h). The modified work-up procedure minimizes side reactions while simplifying the isolation and purification of AMFs. Although higher primary alcohols like 1-pentanol and 1-hexanol and secondary alcohol like 2-propanol were found to be less reactive, use of N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) as a base additive afforded AMFs in excellent yields within 6 h at 65 °C using only slight excess of the alcohol (1.2 eq.) reagent. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Background: Among the third-generation biodiesel feed stock, oleaginous marine yeasts are the least studied microorganisms for such purpose. Results: Wild strains yeasts were isolated from various Tunisian marine sources including fish waste (Candida tenuis CtTun15, Debaryomyces hansenii DhTun2015, Trichosporon asahii TaTun15 and Yarrowia lipolytica YlTun15) and seawater (Rhodotorula mucilaginosa RmTun15). Following incubation with ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS: 75 mM) for various periods of time (T15, T30, T45, T60 min), the cell viability of these strains responded differentially according to yeast species. For instance, mutated CtTun15 did not survive after 30 min of EMS treatment; higher resistances were observed in DhTun2015 (45 min), in YlTun15, RmTun15 and in TaTun15 (60 min) but with significant decreased cell viabilities (survival rate: 6.02, 3.16, 11.22, 11.58, 7.70%, respectively). For all surviving mutated strains, the optima of biomass and lipid yields were detected after 96 h in YPD culture; but derived from strains submitted to different period of EMS incubation. In most mutated strains, the maximum biomass (BP) and lipid (LP) productivities coincided and were observed after 30 min of EMS incubation. Only CtTun15 showed different optima of BP and LP (after 30 min and 15 min, respectively). The fatty acids (FA) compositions considered essential in the prediction of biodiesel criteria; were highly affected by EMS mutagenesis. Essentially, 30- and 45-min EMS incubation induced the highest levels of PUFA and MUFA in YlTun15, RmTun15 and TaTun15 with non-significant differences in the different times. However, CtTun15 and DhTun2015 mutant strains responded differently, with the highest levels of MUFA observed following 15 and 45 min; and that of PUFA after 30 and 45 min, respectively. Conclusion: The methyl-esterification of FA from the three mutated yeast strains (30 min - YlTun15, RmTun15 and TaTun15) yielded biodiesel with physical proprieties consistent with the International Standard System. However, investigations are needed for up-scaling biodiesel production. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Global demand for energy is on the rise at a time when limited natural resources are fast depleting. To address this issue, microalgal biofuels are being recommended as a renewable and eco-friendly substitute for fossil fuels. Euglena gracilis is one such candidate that has received special interest due to their ability to synthesize wax esters that serve as precursors for production of drop-in jet fuel. However, to realize economic viability and achieve industrial-scale production, development of novel methods to characterize algal cells, evaluate its culture conditions, and construct appropriate genetically modified strains is necessary. Here, we report a Raman microspectroscopy-based method to visualize important metabolites such as paramylon and ester during wax ester fermentation in single Euglena gracilis cells in a label-free manner. Results: We measured Raman spectra to obtain intracellular biomolecular information in Euglena under anaerobic condition. First, by univariate approach, we identified Raman markers corresponding to paramylon/esters and constructed their time-lapse chemical images. However, univariate analysis is severely limited in its ability to obtain detailed information as several molecules can contribute to a Raman band. Therefore, we further employed multivariate curve resolution analysis to obtain chain length-specific information and their abundance images of the produced esters. Accumulated esters in Euglena were particularly identified to be myristyl myristate (C28), a wax ester candidate suitable to prepare drop-in jet fuel. Interestingly, we found accumulation of two different forms of myristyl myristate for the first time in Euglena through our exploratory multivariate analysis. Conclusions: We succeeded in visualizing molecular-specific information in Euglena during wax ester fermentation by Raman microspectroscopy. It is obvious from our results that simple univariate approach is insufficient and that multivariate curve resolution analysis is crucial to extract hidden information from Raman spectra. Even though we have not measured any mutants in this study, our approach is directly applicable to other systems and is expected to deepen the knowledge on lipid metabolism in microalgae, which eventually leads to new strategies that will help to enhance biofuel production efficiency in the future. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The co-production of single cell oil (SCO) with value-added products could improve the economic viability of industrial SCO production. The newly isolated oleaginous yeast Cryptococcus podzolicus DSM 27192 was able to co-produce SCO intracellularly and gluconic acid (GA) extracellularly. In this study, the metabolic regulation of carbon distribution between SCO and GA through process optimization was comprehensively investigated. Results: The carbon flow distribution between SCO and GA was significantly influenced by the cultivation conditions, such as nitrogen sources, glucose concentration and dissolved oxygen concentration. It was found that organic nitrogen sources were beneficial for SCO accumulation, while GA production was decreased. Dissolved oxygen concentration (DOC) was found to enhance SCO accumulation, while high glucose concentration was more favorable for GA accumulation. Hence, a two-stage DOC or glucose concentration-controlled strategy was designed to improve cell growth and direct carbon distribution between SCO and GA. Moreover, C. podzolicus DSM 27192 could degrade its stored lipids to synthesize GA in the late stationary phase, although considerable amounts of glucose remained unconsumed in the culture medium, indicating the importance of fermentation time control in co-production systems. All these observations provide opportunity to favor either the production of SCO or GA or rather their simultaneous production. Conclusions: Co-production of SCO and GA by C. podzolicus DSM 27192 can improve the economical value for microbial lipid-derived biodiesel production. Moreover, the results of the proposed co-production strategy might give guidance for other co-production systems. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Aircraft engines are a unique source of carbonaceous aerosols in the upper troposphere. There, these particles can more efficiently interact with solar radiation than at ground. Due to the lack of measurement data, the radiative forcing from aircraft exhaust aerosol remains uncertain. To better estimate the global radiative effects of aircraft exhaust aerosol, its optical properties need to be comprehensively characterized. In this work we present the link between the chemical composition and the optical properties of the particulate matter (PM) measured at the engine exit plane of a CFM56-7B turbofan. The measurements covered a wide range of power settings (thrust), ranging from ground idle to take-off, using four different fuel blends of conventional Jet A-1 and hydro-processed ester and fatty acids (HEFA) biofuel. At the two measurement wavelengths (532 and 870 nm) and for all tested fuels, the absorption and scattering coefficients increased with thrust, as did the PM mass. The analysis of elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) revealed a significant mass fraction of OC (up to 90 %) at low thrust levels, while EC mass dominated at medium and high thrust. The use of HEFA blends induced a significant decrease in the PM mass and the optical coefficients at all thrust levels. The HEFA effect was highest at low thrust levels, where the EC mass was reduced by up to 50 %-60 %. The variability in the chemical composition of the particles was the main reason for the strong thrust dependency of the single scattering albedo (SSA), which followed the same trend as the fraction of OC to total carbon (TC). Mass absorption coefficients (MACs) were determined from the correlations between aerosol light absorption and EC mass concentration. The obtained MAC values (MAC532 D 7:5±0:3 m2 g-1 and MAC870 D 5:2 ± 0:9 m2 g-1) are in excellent agreement with previous literature values of absorption cross section for freshly generated soot. While the MAC values were found to be independent of the thrust level and fuel type, the mass scattering coefficients (MSCs) significantly varied with thrust. For cruise conditions we obtained MSC532 D 4:5 ± 0:4 m2 g-1 and MSC870 D 0:54 ± 0:04 m2 g-1, which fall within the higher end of MSCs measured for fresh biomass smoke. However, the latter comparison is limited by the strong dependency of MSC on the particles' size, morphology and chemical composition. The use of the HEFA fuel blends significantly decreased PM emissions, but no changes were observed in terms of EC=OC composition and radiative properties. © 2019 Author(s).

This study investigates the effects of injection timing (2°CA advance & retard), EGR (up to 30%) and Oct30 (30% by vol. of n-octanol in diesel) on combustion, performance, and emissions of a DI diesel engine. Results in comparison with diesel indicated Oct30 blend presented an enhanced premixed combustion phasing with higher peaks of pressure and HRR. BSFC was found to be slightly higher for Oct30 blend at all EGR rates. Further, when the injection timing is advanced, the blend produced better BSFC. Oct30 delivered better BTE at all injection timings. NOx and smoke emissions are lower for Oct30 at all conditions. Oct30 could overcome the trade-off between smoke and NOx emissions at a combination of certain EGR and injection timings. It was found that at advanced injection, the reduction in NOx and smoke density was 19.02% and 57.14%, respectively, while BTE increased by 4.6% and BSFC increased by 1.3%. At late injection, a reduction of 50.87% in NOx emissions and 15.87% in smoke density was achieved with a slight drop in BTE by 3.5% and an increase in BSFC by 9.7%. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The energy sector is an important factor that influences life quality and economic prosperity. Differences in infrastructure, technology and even in culture of each country make it imperative to include their own characteristics into energy analyses, making it necessary to identify the different types of sources of CO2 emissions and their magnitudes. The aim of this paper is to present a foresight analysis of the productive and energy matrices dynamics in Ecuador for the period 2016–2030 and to propose public policy that contributes to sustainable development. In a first stage, the research has an explanatory character, referring to construction of a model, which uses an extended variation of the Kaya Identity where the volume of CO2 emissions may be examined quantifying contributions of productive sectors activity, sectorial energy intensity, energy matrix, and CO2 emission features. Subsequently, the research acquires a predictive-experimental nature, using exploratory scenarios. That allows linking historic and present events with hypothetical futures. In consequence, driving forces of the scenario can be explained and analysed using quantitative modelling based on the Kaya Identity and qualitative narratives. Within this study two scenarios were built. The Business as Usual scenario, without modifying the structure of productive and energy matrices, and the Alternative scenario that seeks to reduce the consumption of oil derivatives in land transport, which consumes 50% of the country’s energy demand. The Alternative scenario, which promotes the use of biofuels, projects to reduce the CO2 emissions from 45.58 to 43.41 Mt of CO2 equivalent for 2030. The policy on biofuels in Ecuador is at an early stage. So, biofuels offer important opportunities: i) diversification of the energy matrix, ii) contribution to energy security, iii) promotion of the growth of the industrial sector, and iv) substitution of fossil fuels and mitigation of the greenhouse gas effects. © Lietuvos mokslų akademija, 2019.

AB  - The worldwide spillage of fossil fuels causes an ever-increasing environmental concern due to their resistance to biodegradation and toxicity. The diesel fuel is one of the derivative forms of petroleum that is widely used in the world. Its composition has many aromatic compounds and long hydrocarbons chains, both persistent and hazardous, thus requiring complex microbial dynamics to achieve full biodegradation. At this point, biodiesel has advantages because it is produced from renewable sources. It also has a relatively fast biodegradation. Biodiesel formulation chemically varies according to the raw material used for its production. While vegetable oils tend to have homogeneous proportions of linoleic and oleic fatty acids, animal fats have an heterogeneous distribution of stearic, palmitic and oleic fatty acids. As some studies have already detected the toxic potential of biodiesel from vegetable oil, this study sought information on the phytotoxic and genotoxic potential of animal fat-based biodiesel and compare it with fossil fuel as diesel fuel and crude petroleum. The impacts on the microbial activity of soils contaminated with biodiesel, diesel fuel and crude petroleum were performed by the dehydrogenase activity. Phytotoxicity tests were performed with Eruca sativa seeds and genotoxicity bioassays with Allium cepa seeds. The results showed a rapid assimilation of biodiesel by the autochthonous soil microorganisms. Soil contaminated with either diesel or crude petroleum inhibited the root and hypocotyl elongation of E. sativa. Overall, petroleum contaminated soils showed higher genotoxic potential. Biodiesel from animal fat was rapidly assimilated by soil microorganisms and did not present significant phytotoxic or genotoxic potential, but significantly reduced the mitotic index of A. cepa roots. Our results showed that biodiesel from animal fat have rapid biodegradability. Biodiesel also led to less impacts during seed development and lower genotoxic potential when compared to crude petroleum and diesel fuel. In addition, biodiesel from animal fat does not present the same toxicity demonstrated by biodiesel from soybean-based biodiesel described in current literature. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Biodiesel has been proved as a promising solution among other alternate fuels in terms of its characteristics compared to diesel. The oxidation property of biodiesel results in the degradation of its quality. This problem can be solved by the addition of suitable antioxidants which improves the oxidation stability of the fuel. Usage of natural antioxidants offsets the defects in synthetic antioxidants, because they are renewable, nontoxic as well as cost effective. In the present investigation the effects of commercially available and cheap natural leaf extract additive such as Albizia Lebbeck (AL), Melia Azedarach (MA) and Psidium Guajava (PG) have mixed with jamun biodiesel blend (JOME20) at various concentrations like 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 ppm to accelerated oxidation stability of the biodiesel blend. Characterization of biodiesel oxidation variability regarding different antioxidants is evaluated using Fourier Transform Infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy by analyzing the FTIR spectrum regions of C[sbnd]H bonds of the respective antioxidants/biodiesel blends. The AL dosed with 20% of jamun biodiesel (JOME20) enhances the oxidation stability by 25.27%, when compared to those of JOME20 without any antioxidant. The order of effectiveness of antioxidants at 1000 ppm concentration with JOME20 is obtained as AL &gt; MA &gt; PG. Further, the experiment is conducted with jamun oil methyl ester (JOME) as a fuel in CI engine are studied. Engine tests are performed using the blends of 20% Jamun Oil Methyl Ester (JOME20) and 100% Jamun Oil Methyl Ester (JOME100) with diesel as fuel. The performance results revealed that improved brake thermal efficiency and marginally lowered specific fuel consumption for JOME20 blend compared to diesel. The emission parameters such as CO, CO2, HC and smoke are decreased considerably. But, the NOx is increased by 10.6% compared to diesel. Therefore, in the present study aims to control the NOx emission by using natural leaf extract additives mixed with JOME20 blend. Finally, it is concluded that JOME20 with 1000 ppm of AL is showed reduction of NOx emission up to 8.67% compared to diesel. Further, the oxidation stability of the biodiesel is increased significantly. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - One of the major factors in the success of renewable energy is finding a proper location for production facilities. At a national level, different parts of a country (e.g. provinces) can be seen as alternatives that can be assessed based on a set of criteria, and ranking them to identify the best location. The focus in this paper is on identifying the best location for the production of bioethanol. After a comprehensive literature review, an evaluation framework is proposed based on the three dimensions of sustainability (economic, environmental and social). Using data provided by a sample of experts in a developing country – Iran – and applying the best-worst method (BWM), a number of decision-making criteria are evaluated. Performance data involving the various provinces of Iran are collected from different sources. The performance data and the weights identified through BWM are used to calculate an overall score for each province, which is then used to rank the provinces, with the province of Khuzestan (closely followed by Tehran) being identified as the most suitable province for bioethanol production in Iran. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bacteria that are capable of accumulating lipids in their cells as storage compounds can also produce polyhydroxyalkanoates of high technological value, depending on the specific culture conditions. The objective of this study was to utilize crude glycerol from biodiesel (CGB) as a substrate, which is a major byproduct from biodiesel production, to produce lipophilic compounds. Bacillus megaterium INCQS 425 was cultivated and evaluated for the production of lipophilic compounds and the properties of these compounds were investigated. Cultivation of the bacteria in a medium with a C:N ratio of 0.60:1 favored the accumulation of lipids by (17.5%) comprising mainly palmitic acid (13.08%), palmitoleic (39.48%), and especially oleic acid (37.02%), which imparts good characteristics to biodiesel. Meanwhile, cultivation of the bacteria in a medium with a C:N ratio of 4:1 favored the accumulation of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) (3.31 g L−1) mainly comprising medium and long chain PHA. Low crystallinity (&lt;30%) and excellent thermal properties make them suitable for processes that demand high temperatures, such as extrusion. The lipids produced in the present study had satisfactory oxidative stability for the production of quality biodiesel. The polyhydroxyalkanoates produced in the study are of low cost and have promising thermal properties that justify its technological potential, thereby configuring highly competitive bioproducts. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In order to improve the storage stability of bio-oil from pine wood pyrolysis with fluidized bed reactor, methanol in different proportions (3 wt%, 6 wt%, 9 wt%, 12 wt% and 15 wt%) was added into bio-oil. The changes of physicochemical properties of bio-oil samples such as water content, pH value and viscosity and the aging chemical reaction mechanism during 35 days storage were investigated. Water content and viscosity of the methanol addition group were obviously lower than that of the raw bio-oil, which indicates that methanol could effectively inhibit the generation of water and greatly reduce viscosity during storage. When the methanol content was higher than 6.0 wt%, pH value began to increase with the storage duration. GC–MS and FT-IR analysis results showed that the component and structure of bio-oil were changed. During the storage, some reactions, e.g. polymerization reaction and aging reactions, occurred in bio-oil samples and the addition of methanol could delay the aging process of unimolecular elimination reaction (E1 elimination reaction). Phenols of methanol/bio-oil could react following three possible reaction mechanisms according to guaiacols ortho-methoxyl substitution, unimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN1) reaction and bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction of ortho-hydroxyl substitution of catechol. As a conclusion, the addition of methanol could improve the bio-oil storage stability and be beneficial for its application. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To clarify the conversion mechanism of methyl palmitate (C16:0) to produce jet biofuel over Ni/desilicated meso-Y zeolite catalyst, quantum chemistry calculation and verification experiments were conducted to evaluate three proposed competitive reaction pathways, in which hydrodecarboxylation pathway was more feasible than hydrogenolysis and decarboxylation pathways. It was found that overall enthalpy change to produce pentadecane (−130.2 kJ/mol) in hydrodecarboxylation pathway was lower than that to produce palmitic acid (−90.1 kJ/mol) in hydrogenolysis pathway and that to produce hexadecane (−68.6 kJ/mol) in decarboxylation pathway. The experimental results of hydrodeoxygenation and hydrocracking conversion of methyl palmitate into jet biofuel were consistent with quantum chemistry calculation, when conventional Y zeolite was modified into hierarchical mesoporous Y zeolite catalyst by desilication with NaOH and then loading Ni nanoparticles. The jet biofuel product selectivity reached a peak (64.8%) with reasonable composition distributions, when Ni/meso-Y zeolite was desilicated with 0.4 M NaOH to promote BET surface area (554.9 m2/g) and specific pore volume (0.340 cm3/g) with 2–10 nm mesopores. The relative content of pentadecane in liquid products was always higher than those of palmitic acid and hexadecane over Ni/meso-Y zeolite catalysts desilicated with various concentrations of NaOH. The main compositions of gas phase by-products in hydrodeoxygenation and hydrocracking conversion were CH4 with selectivity up to 25.2% and CO2 with selectivity of ∼10%, which agreed well with quantum chemistry calculation results. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In search for a feasible replacement for fossil fuels, there has been extensive research into biofuels in the past few decades. Oxygenated compounds, such as anisole, in particular have shown some promising characteristics. Anisole is an oxygenated biofuel widely adopted as a solvent and seems to be an apt fuel for the combustion application. Although being a potential biofuel, only a few investigations have been conducted for anisole; therefore, a lack of supplementary experiments in high temperatures and engine-relevant conditions is obvious. The experimental results are also highly demanded as a source of verification and update for the available chemical kinetic mechanisms. In this research, performance characteristics of anisole are studied; specifically, the Laminar Burning Speed (LBS), flame structure, and flame stability have been experimentally and theoretically discussed. The calculations have been produced using a constant volume combustion chamber (CVCC) and a z-type schlieren optical technique accompanying a differential-based multi-shell thermodynamic model. The data has been reported in a wide range of temperatures (T = 460–550 K), pressures (p = 0.5–5.5 atm), and equivalence ratios (ϕ = 0.8–1.4). In order to provide a convenient way for other researchers to access LBS for anisole in a wider range, a power-law correlation has been presented for LBS as a function of p, T and ϕ. Regarding the flame structure, the hydrodynamic sources have been shown to be the main influential root to spherical flame instabilities which is directly related with ϕ and reversely to pressure. The experiments demonstrated that anisole has a relatively high laminar burning speed, with a maximum at ϕ = 1.1 for different p and T conditions. As expected, the LBS increases by increasing the temperature and reducing the pressure. The two available chemical mechanisms for anisole combustion have been compared with the experimental results and a need for modification in the mechanisms are observed. A sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the sources of discrepancies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

The soybean methyl ester was used as a representative composition of typical biodiesel fuels. The heating and evaporation of ethanol–biodiesel–diesel (EBD) blends were investigated using the Discrete–Component (DC) model. The Cetane Number (CN) of the EBD blends was predicted based on the individual hydrocarbon contributions in the mixture. The mixture viscosity was predicted using the Universal Quasi-Chemical Functional group Activity Coefficients and Viscosity (UNIFAC–VISCO) method, and the lower heating value of the mixture was predicted based on the volume fractions and density of species and blends. Results revealed that a mixture of up to 15% biodiesel, 5% ethanol, and 80% diesel fuels had led to small variations in droplet lifetime, CN, viscosity, and heating value of pure diesel, with less than 1.2%, 0.2%, 2%, and 2.2% reduction in those values, respectively. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Bimetallic Pt-MoOx supported on ZrO2 exhibits higher catalytic activity than known catalysts for converting fatty acids into green diesel at as low as 200 °C. A change in selectivity from decarboxylation/decarbonylation to hydrodeoxygenation and enhancement in the deoxygenation activity of Pt were observed when MoOx was also present in the catalyst composition. In X-ray photoelectron spectra, Pt 4f lines of 4Pt-8MoOx/ZrO2 occurred at lower binding energies than those for 4Pt/ZrO2. Part of Mo was reduced from +6 to +5 oxidation state in the presence of Pt. There seems to exist some electronic interaction between the support and metal, making 4Pt-8MoOx/ZrO2 a highly efficient and selective deoxygenation catalyst. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present paper aims to investigate the environmental and economic impacts of co-processing petroleum fractions with bio-based feedstocks for direct refinery integration versus the conventional drop-in integration of biofuels with compatible transportation fuels. Three different pathways of market diesel (commercial diesel fuel from a typical fuel station in Greece) production with 10% v/v biocontent (biomass feed) were explored by variant biomass utilization with fossil counter parts (diesel fuel). The first case study depicts the current market diesel production process via blending petroleum fractions with FAME (Fatty Acids Methyl Esters) biodiesel. The second case study involves the production of market diesel from blending petroleum fractions with hydrotreated residual lipids (Waste Cooking Oil, WCO), while the third case study explores the alternative approach of co-processing petroleum fractions with WCO. In all cases, the market diesel production chain was based on the hydrotreating process simulated using Aspen Plus. The results have shown that the most beneficial case, by environmental and economic viewpoint, for market diesel production with 10% v/v biocontent in the Greek market is co-processing of petroleum fractions with WCO. This approach accounts for a reduced production cost (751 €/m 3 ) and environmentally friendly profile (243 kgCO 2 -eq/m 3 ) compared with the other two case studies. Additionally co-processing of residual biomass with petroleum fractions utilizes existing infrastructure towards the production of sustainable fuels, rendering this pathway more attractive form a CAPEX point of view. © 2019

AB  - This paper proposes a possibilistic programming model in order to design a second-generation biodiesel supply chain network under epistemic uncertainty of input data. The developed model minimizes the total cost of the supply chain from supply centers to the biodiesel and glycerin consumer centers. Waste cooking oil and Jatropha plants, as non-edible feedstocks, are considered for biodiesel production. To cope with the epistemic uncertainty of the parameters, a credibility-based possibilistic programming approach is employed to convert the original possibilistic programming model into a crisp counterpart. An accelerated benders decomposition algorithm using efficient acceleration mechanisms is devised to deal with the computational complexity of solving the proposed model in an efficient manner. The performance of the proposed possibilistic programming model and the efficiency of the developed accelerated benders decomposition algorithm are validated by performing a computational analysis using a real case study in Iran. © 2019

AB  - The growing global energy demand, the fossil fuel depletion and increasing CO2 and pollutant emissions in arising from human activities are increasingly impacting the economy and government measures. For this reason, the automotive industry is constantly in search for new and environment friendly technologies and strategies, such as the use of biofuels and the variation in air-fuel ratio. These strategies have already been vastly studied, but few studies were conducted with ethanol. Thereby, this paper aims to analyze and compare the effects of ethanol and gasoline mixture enleanment in a flex-fuel engine in terms of performance, emissions and combustion. For this, it was evaluated how indicated specific fuel consumption (ISFC), emissions and combustion patterns are affected when using both Brazilian commercial gasoline (E27) and hydrous ethanol (E96) in lean conditions. The results show similar combustion parameter behavior for both fuels, pointing to ISFC reduction when operating in lean combustion modes of more than 5% and 12% for ethanol and gasoline, respectively. Despite the lower thermal and fuel conversion efficiencies resulting from the smaller Lower Heating Value (LHV), the advantage of the biofuel appears in the emission analysis. For both fuels, lean combustion results in virtual elimination of carbon monoxide (CO) emission, decreasing of 89% in nitrogen oxides (NOx) for ethanol and 74% for gasoline. Added to this, ethanol's combustion results in lower HC emission, highlighting the potential of this biofuel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel has recently received increasing attention because of many advantages such as higher cetane number and flash point compared to diesel fuel. However, corrosion of engine parts exposed to biodiesel or biodiesel-diesel fuel blends is still a critical challenge in the biodiesel industry. In the existing literature, there is still a lack of systematic studies including corrosion process in light alloy and changes in mechanical and fuel properties of engine parts (such as brass) after exposure to biodiesel. Therefore, in this study, (1) waste sunflower oil biodiesel (WSOB, B100) was supplied and blended with diesel fuel (B0) at the volume ratios of 10%, 20%, and 40%, which are called as B10, B20, and B40, as usual. The important fuel properties of the biodiesel-diesel fuel blends were also analyzed using ASTM test methods. (2) Corrosion characteristics of brass exposed to the biodiesel-diesel fuel blends were determined by means of a static immersion method at room temperature. (3) Mechanical properties of brass were investigated before and after the corrosion test. Finally, (4) variations in surface morphologies of the brass coupons were researched. According to the experimental results, the corrosion rate (0.3810 mpy) of brass exposed to B100 was found to be higher than that of brass exposed to B0 (0.1330 mpy) for the exposure duration of 960 hours. The Brinell hardness numbers (BHN) were determined as 406.265, 477.713, 541.983, 579.448, and 636.602 N/mm 2 while the tensile strengths (TS) were 1381.30, 1624.22, 1842.743, 1970.13, and 2164.45 MPa for B0, B10, B20, B40, and B100, respectively. BHN and TS values of B10 were closer to that of B0. Therefore, B10 was found to be a more suitable alternative to diesel fuel in terms of fuel property and corrosion characteristic. The results of this study can promote thermo-physical property collection for biofuels and guide for corrosion studies related to the industrial applications of diesel-biodiesel blends and pure biodiesel. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - India is a developing economy, and an energy-hungry state. With its ever increasing demand for fuel, India is the fourth largest consumer of crude oil in the world and imports 70% of its total demand. Also, to reduce the carbon footprint, the search is on for eco-friendly and renewable sources of energy. In India, one such unconventional fuel is ethanol produced from sugarcane molasses and blended with gasoline for use as biofuel. In this paper, the authors propose an entrepreneurial project to produce ethanol from maize, with an objective to develop a clean & green source of energy and to give a boost to the agricultural economy. Maize is the third most important crop in India, with approximate 85% of areal coverage. It has applications in adhesives, food industry, beverages and breweries for producing ethanol. Ethanol produced from maize has advantages over sugarcane, as the fibrous byproduct makes an excellent animal feedstock and can be further processed for the production of corn starch and syrup, to maximize the profit. The present paper suggests an entrepreneurial opportunity for commercial production of ethanol from maize directly purchased from farmers, creating a win–win scenario for farmers as well as the enterprise. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Tobacco plants can be developed as an energy crop for biofuels production. Tobacco represents a well-established non-food crop with an over 400-year tradition of cultivation in the United States. It is the most popular non-food crop in the world, grown in more than 120 other countries. Energy tobacco as a platform biomass for biofuels, combined with a water-based green-process technology to produce fermentable sugars from tobacco plants or tobacco stalks, was the aim of this study. The composition analysis showed that non-structural sugars in modified or unmodified tobacco leaves are comparable to those of energy crops (switch grass, miscanthus), whereas lignin content in tobacco leaves is significantly lower. Moreover, the elemental analysis of tobacco leaves showed that the carbon content is in the range of 37–39 wt% on a dry basis, and oil content was about 5 wt%. Upon hydrolysis, more than 75 wt% of structural or non-structural sugars in tobacco biomass was available as glucose. The results showed that tobacco cellulose could be effectively converted to hydrolytic products (glucose, cellobiose and oligosaccharides) within a few seconds under hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) conditions. There are some parameters that are crucial for a successful HTL reaction, such as residence time, temperature, pressure and the particle size of the biomass. © 2016, © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Every year billions of tons of fish waste are produced by fish processing units. These wastes when dumped into the environment cause emissions which in turn degrade the land. An alternative solution for the problem involves their processing into biofuel, pharmacological components, fertilizer and fodder. Biofuel is a trending concept and an alternative for present day fuels. Biofuels are pollution free and thus are advantageous over current fuels. Biofuels are produced from organic waste, seaweed, and micro-algae. The current research on fish wastes for the production of biodiesel is mainly because of their nontoxic and biodegradable nature. Biodiesel produces less air toxins, CO2, hydrocarbons and other particulates when compared to the standard fuel or diesel. The conversion process involves extraction of fish oil from the waste of the fishing industry. The oil is cleaned and purified. With the addition of a catalyst, biodiesel and bio-gas are produced by transesterification and anaerobic digestion respectively. Various results such as Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance (FT-NMR), gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-NMR) analysis, and best management practices (BMP) assay show the efficient conversion and working of biofuels. © 2016, © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The influence of main nutrient stress conditions KNO3, MgSO4, K2HPO4 and KCl on biofuel production from biomass by two Botryococcus braunii strains has been investigated. Low concentrations of KNO3 and MgSO4 exhibited positive effect on hydrocarbon, oil contents and their relative ratios without much affecting the growth. Most of the saturated hydrocarbons were identified in the range of C15 to C44, the major ones being C17H34, C19H38, C21H44, C24H50 and C27H56. Fatty acids ranged from C12 to C28, with palmitic, linoleic, oleic and stearic acids being the major ones. The relative proportion of the desirable biofuel component, palmitic acid, was significantly increased under NO3 1−, PO4 3− and potassium stress conditions. These findings suggest that monitoring of concentration of a few nutrients may enhance the quantity and desirable types of biofuel components together with substantial growth of Botryococcus braunii for bioenergy production and for commercial large scale cultivation. © 2016, © 2016 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The performance and emission characteristics of homogeneous charge compression ignition engine, with micro algae oil blended B20 was investigated. The DI engine was converted to HCCI engine mode by adopted PFI technique (diesel vaporize through air heating and external mixture preparation of air-fuel). All the experiments were conducted at constant speed of 1500 rpm with four different EGR percentage ranges (0%, 10%, 20% and 30%) and three different intake air temperatures (100°C, 120°C and 140°C). Experimental results indicated the BTE and SFC are optimal at 120°C injected air temperature and 20% of EGR. The increment in load conditions induced high knocking tendency further lead to increase in emission and high heat release rate (HRR). The increased in inlet air temperature resulted the quality combustion as well as reduced CO & HC slightly and more NOx emissions. High inlet air temperature and high EGR produced more emissions. © 2019 Scientific Publishers. All rights reserved.

AB  - A study of converting fresh and waste sunflower oil to biodiesel through transesterification reaction using heterogeneous catalysts is established. Calcium Oxide (CaO) was selected as a basic heterogeneous catalyst because it is the cheapest and the most available comparing with other options. The characteristics of the catalyst were evaluated using several evaluation tests. The results confirm that the best preparation condition is at 850ºC and 2 hours. This catalyst has demonstrated positive results, high productivity and good recycling potential. The best conditions for reaction were obtained by varying the reaction conditions to obtain the highest bio-fuel production. The reaction has been studied in various operating conditions of methanol to oil molar ratio, catalyst loading, agitation speed and reaction time at temperature 65ºC. The maximum yield of biodiesel was 97.4% for fresh vegetable oil. Moreover, the catalyst shows perfect results for transesterification of waste vegetable oil. It was tested for market waste sunflower oil and home waste sunflower oil, where the yield was 88.2% and 91.6% respectively. The reuse of the catalyst showed good activity with no less than 5 cycles. So, the production of biodiesel using calcium oxide as a catalyst is a perfect promising approach. © 2019, World Research Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Catalyst-type mixed metal oxides with different compositions and Co/Fe ratios were obtained from layered double hydroxides to be used as heterogeneous catalysts in the production of biodiesel. The effect of the Co/Fe ratio on the precursors of the catalysts was analyzed, considering their thermal, textural and structural properties. The physicochemical properties of the catalysts were determined by thermogravimetric analysis (differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric), X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and N2-physisorption. The conversion to biodiesel using the different catalysts obtained was determined by diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy and 1H-Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, allowing us to correlate the effect of the catalyst composition with the catalytic capacity. The conditions for obtaining biodiesel were optimized by selecting the catalyst and varying the percentage of catalyst, the methanol/oil ratio and the reaction time. The catalysts reached yields of conversion to biodiesel of up to 96% in 20 min of reaction using only 2% catalyst. The catalyst that showed the best catalytic activity contains a mixture of predominant crystalline and amorphous phases of CoFe2O4 and NaxCoO2. The results suggest that cobalt is a determinant in the activity of the catalyst when forming active sites in the crystalline network of mixed oxides for the transesterification of triglycerides, with high conversion capacity and selectivity to biodiesel. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The bio-oil was largely produced by thermal pyrolysis of Jatropha-derived biomass wastes (denoted as Jatropha bio-oil) using a pilot plant with a capacity of 20 kg h-1 at Thailand Institute of Scientific and Technological Research (TISTR), Thailand. Jatropha bio-oil is an unconventional type of bio-oil, which is mostly composed of fatty acids, fatty acid methyl esters, fatty acid amides, and derivatives, and consequently, it contains large amounts of heteroatoms (oxygen ~20 wt.%, nitrogen ~ 5 wt.%, sulfur ~ 1000 ppm.). The heteroatoms, especially nitrogen, are highly poisonous to the metal or sulfide catalysts for upgrading of Jatropha bio-oil. To overcome this technical problem, we reported a stepwise strategy for hydrotreating of 100 wt.% Jatropha bio-oil over mesoporous sulfide catalysts (CoMo/γ-Al2O3 and NiMo/γ-Al2O3) to produce drop-in transport fuels, such as gasoline- and diesel-like fuels. This study is very different from our recent work on co-processing of Jatropha bio-oil (ca. 10 wt.%) with petroleum distillates to produce a hydrotreated oil as a diesel-like fuel. Jatropha bio-oil was pre-treated through a slurry-type high-pressure reactor under severe conditions, resulting in a pre-treated Jatropha bio-oil with relatively low amounts of heteroatoms (oxygen &lt; 20 wt.%, nitrogen &lt; 2 wt.%, sulfur &lt; 500 ppm.). The light and middle distillates of pre-hydrotreated Jatropha bio-oil were then separated by distillation at a temperature below 240 °C, and a temperature of 240–360 °C. Deep hydrotreating of light distillates over sulfide CoMo/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was performed on a batch-type high-pressure reactor at 350 °C and 7 MPa of H2 gas for 5 h. The hydrotreated oil was a gasoline-like fuel, which contained 29.5 vol.% of n-paraffins, 14.4 vol.% of iso-paraffins, 4.5 vol.% of olefins, 21.4 vol.% of naphthene compounds and 29.6 wt.% of aromatic compounds, and little amounts of heteroatoms (nearly no oxygen and sulfur, and less than 50 ppm of nitrogen), corresponding to an octane number of 44, and it would be suitable for blending with petro-gasoline. The hydrotreating of middle distillates over sulfide NiMo/γ-Al2O3 catalyst using the same reaction condition produced a hydrotreating oil with diesel-like composition, low amounts of heteroatoms (no oxygen and less than 50 ppm of sulfur and nitrogen), and a cetane number of 60, which would be suitable for use in drop-in diesel fuel. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Biofuels have been considered to be sustainable energy source and one of the major alternatives to petroleum-based road transport fuels due to a reduction of greenhouse gases emissions. However, their effects on urban air pollution are not straightforward. The main objective of this work is to estimate the emissions and energy use from bio-fuelled vehicles by using an integrated and flexible modelling approach at the urban scale in order to contribute to the understanding of introducing biofuels as an alternative transport fuel. For this purpose, the new Traffic Emission and Energy Consumption Model (QTraffic) was applied for complex urban road network when considering two biofuels demand scenarios with different blends of bioethanol and biodiesel in comparison to the reference situation over the city of Coimbra (Portugal). The results of this study indicate that the increase of biofuels blends would have a beneficial effect on particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions reduction for the entire road network (-3.1% [-3.8% to -2.1%] by kg). In contrast, an overall negative effect on nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions at urban scale is expected, mainly due to the increase in bioethanol uptake. Moreover, the results indicate that, while there is no noticeable variation observed in energy use, fuel consumption is increased by over 2.4% due to the introduction of the selected biofuels blends. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Economic progress, development of transport, production of new cars, production of more and more energy, and the combustion of fossil fuels are causing huge changes that are currently occurring in the environment. Ecological problems of the contemporary economy combined with perspectives of resources exhaustion, as well as the need to follow sustainable rules of living, require the search for new fuels. Fuels which can assure their availability and good environmental performance are needed for maintaining sustainable transportation. Knowledge about the behavior of various fuels is necessary for realistic methods of technology management in transportation means and the fuel industry. This paper describes biofuels that can be an addition to petrol or can exist as standalone fuels. A simulation was carried out on an urban vehicle and the tested fuels were petrol 95, ethanol, methanol, and dimethyl ether. For the selected engine a simulation corresponding to that of the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) test was created using the Scilab package. Based on this simulation, values of carbon dioxide and water vapor emission were determined. The fuel demand for each fuel mixture and the amount of air for the fuels used were also calculated (and verified on the basis of laboratory tests). It was demonstrated that addition of biofuel decreases emission of carbon dioxide, simultaneously increasing emission of water vapor. Biofuel additive also caused an increase in fuel consumption. Unfortunately, in the New European Driving Cycle test being investigated, carbon dioxide emissions in all cases exceeded the permissible level of 130 g CO2/km, which is bad news in the context of the further tightening of norms and standards. The simulation tests confirmed that when using the start/stop system and applying specific additives, the carbon dioxide emission decreases and the consumption of mixtures with the activated start/stop system is smaller. The analyzed problems and results of this analysis become more important in light of the Worldwide Harmonized Light Duty Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP) standard, which became binding from September 2018 and applies to the sale of cars that had been approved prior (in accordance with the New European Driving Cycle standard). Although the NEDC standard appears obsolete the computer model simulating this type of test will be necessary in many cases. It is, however, needed and possible to develop a similar simulation procedure for WLTP tests. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Livestock production is among the most rapidly growing sectors of the agricultural economy driven primarily by growing demand for animal protein, but also posing significant waste disposal issues and environmental impacts. Moreover, opportunities exist for utilising animal waste at the farm level for heat and power generation (thermal conversion) which can contribute to economic sustainability and also provide a bio-fertiliser for soil amendment. The present study is focused on energy and nutrient recovery from poultry litter using a thermochemical conversion technology (fast pyrolysis). The formation of products (gases, biochar and bio-oil) during the fast pyrolysis of poultry litter was experimentally investigated in a laboratory-scale bubbling fluidised bed reactor. Pyrolytic gases accounted for 15-22 wt.% of the product. The carbon content in biochar increased from 47 to 48.5 wt.% with an increase in the pyrolysis temperature. Phosphorous and potassium recovery in the biochar were over 75%, suggesting that it could be used as an organic soil amendment. The high ash content in poultry litter (14.3 wt.%) resulted in low bio-oil and high biochar yield. The bio-oil yield was over 27 wt.% with a higher heating value of 32.17 MJ/kg (dry basis). The total acid number of the bio-oil decreased from 46.30 to 38.50 with an increase in temperature. The nitrogen content in the bio-oil produced from the poultry litter (>7 wt.%) was significantly higher compared to bio-oil produced from the wood (0.1 wt.%). © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The challenge of developing a sustainable production system includes the reduction of emissions, the efficient use of resources, and the transition to renewable energy. The bioeconomy proposes a development model aimed at reducing impacts and risks associated with the use of non-renewable resources considering the life cycle of products. The European Union is promoting products from renewable sources focused on biochemicals and bio-based plastics, which are high added value products when compared to biofuels. The aim of this paper is to consider sustainability in terms of the environmental, economic, and social aspects of use of bio-based plastics in the fruit chain, considering the case study of raspberry supply chains in northwestern Italy. Different analyses (life-cycle assessment (LCA), life-cycle costing (LCC), and externality assessment (ExA)) were used to assess the impacts along the whole chain by means of an integrated approach. The results show that the bio-based plastic scenario has lower environmental and social impacts than the conventional one, whereas the latter is the best choice according to a classic economic approach. The introduction of bio-based plastics as a replacement for traditional plastics in agri-food chains is the first step toward the use of renewable resources with a low impact on society. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Engine performance and mapping were done using diesel and used cooking oil biodiesel fuels. This was done using the Tempest, 1500 cc compression ignition engine testbed. This engine is connected to a dynamometer testbed and its control panel to measure the needed performance parameters. The crankshaft speed varied between 35 and 60 rps, while the load tested from no load to full load. The engine speed according to the manufacturer should not exceed 60 rps. The coolant temperature remained almost constant at around 70oC. The experimental results were then utilized to adjust the engine simulation model using the Diesel-RK software. Results showed that improvement in engine operation with diesel is slightly compared with that of biodiesel fuel. It was also found that the combustion process with biodiesel starts earlier during the mixing phase than diesel fuel. The primary results showed that using potassium hydroxide as a catalyst, the biodiesel yielded 45% more compared with sodium hydroxide, 5% higher calorific value, and 10% lower viscosity. From mapping point of view, the results showed that biofuel has a lower thermal efficiency than the regular diesel. A diesel-powered engine has the lowest fuel consumption of around 250–300 g/kWh at the relatively higher power and mean effective pressure values. While for the biodiesel fuels this is around 350 g/kWh at relatively lower engine speeds, power, and mean effective cylinder pressure. From heat release rate point of view, biodiesel burns earlier than diesel fuel due to higher cetane number and reduced delay periods, on cylinder pressure and temperatures, for the ignition timing and engine-operating parameters, diesel shows better performance than biodiesel for high and half loads. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Exposure to diesel exhaust particles (DEP) has been linked to adverse human health outcomes. DEPs are reactive and can directly or indirectly lead to oxidative stress, which promotes inflammation in the body. The oxidative potential (OP) of DEPs is not well understood, particularly for combustion with alternative fuels, under different engine loads, and in combination with modern emissions control devices. In this study, we measured the OP of DEPs using a dithiothreitol assay (OP-DTT) from a modern-day non-road diesel engine for two different fuels (conventional diesel and soy-based biodiesel), two different engine loads (idle and 50% load), and with and without an emissions control system. The OP-DTT of DEPs was sensitive to the fuel used and the presence of an emissions control system but not to the engine load. On average, the use of biodiesel resulted in factor of ∼6 reduction in OP-DTT normalized to the DEP mass and a factor of ∼12 reduction in OP-DTT normalized to the fuel consumed. The use of the emissions control, on average, resulted in a factor of ∼6 reduction in OP-DTT normalized to the DEP mass and a three order of magnitude decrease in OP-DTT normalized to the fuel consumed. When studied in conjunction with the DEP composition, the OP-DTT seemed to correlate most strongly with elemental carbon (EC), followed by semi-volatile organic vapors. Assays performed on DEPs where EC was deliberately filtered out suggested that the species responsible for the OP-DTT might be correlated with EC but would need to be water soluble (e.g., quinones). The semi-volatile organic vapors accounted for more than a quarter of the OP-DTT of DEPs collected on the quartz filters. Finally, sensitivity studies performed with a different filter membrane (i.e., Teflon®) and solvent (i.e., dichloromethane) tended to increase the OP-DTT value. OP-DTT is emerging as an important metric for studying the adverse effects of DEPs and PM2.5 on human health; results of this work help define the sources and components of diesel PM2.5 that contribute to OP-DTT. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Biofuel is a renewable energy source for transportation. Given the toxicity associated with particulate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is not fully understood, investigating the difference of adverse health risks posed between vapor and particulate PAH emissions from biodiesel-fueled engine combustion was the objective of this study. Three different fuel types, including typical diesel, emulsified diesel with a water fraction from 10 to 19% (v/v), and emulsified biodiesel with water (10%) and biofuel fractions from 10 to 40% (v/v), were studied. The fugacity model and risk assessment were conducted to predict the health risks when different fuels were used. In the results, the addition of water and biofuel elevated and reduced the total PAH emissions in the exhausts, respectively. After the emission, chrysene and benzo(a)anthracene were two dominant carcinogenic species in the environment. The excess cancer risk of the PAH emission significantly decreased (e.g., up to two orders of magnitude) while the emulsified biodiesel was applied, with limiting the formation of benzo(a)pyrene being the explanation. The PAH emissions with molecular weights ranging from 166 to 255 g/mol were significantly different between the vapor and particulate phases during the emulsified biodiesel combustion (p < 0.01). From the viewpoint of cancer risk, the contribution posed by the particulate PAHs was significantly greater than those by the vapor PAHs (e.g., from 54% (benzo(a)pyrene) to 76% (benzo(b)fluoranthene)). Benzo(a)pyrene and chrysene represent the species with the highest and lowest risks, respectively. The multi-ringed PAHs with four or five rings were more indicative of potential cancer risk posed by the PAHs associated with particulate matters during combustion of the emulsified biodiesel. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2019.

AB  - Biodiesel is regarded as the most promising renewable biofuel which can satisfy the worldwide energy demand through its robust net energy output with less impact on environment and also an effective alternative or supplement for existing diesel fuel for powering Compression Ignition engines. This present study aims to compare the performance, combustion and emission characteristics of beef tallow biodiesel with its dominant fatty acid esters and their influence on these characteristics. Ethyl stearate, ethyl palmitate and ethyl oleate were identified as dominant fatty acid esters available in a composition of 14.78, 37.36 and 25.17%, respectively. Two set of samples were prepared for testing purpose and were classified as (i) blend samples and (ii) ester samples, with plain diesel as base fuel. The maximum cylinder pressure was found to be in the range between 67 and 71 bar for all the samples and heat release rate was found to be highest for B20 blend. Slight decrease in efficiency along with marginal increase in fuel consumption was a result of long chained fatty acid esters (stearate and oleate esters) whereas increase in CO2 emission and decrease in NOX emission were because of higher oxygen content, cetane number and degree of unsaturation in the ester molecule. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) is among the largest renewable energy mandates in the world. The policy is enforced using tradeable credits that implicitly subsidize biofuels and tax fossil fuels. The RFS relies on these taxes and subsidies to be passed through to consumers to stimulate demand for biofuels and decrease demand for gasoline and diesel. We study pass-through of the RFS subsidy for E85, a high-ethanol blend fuel, to retail fuel prices using weekly prices from over 450 fuel stations in the United States. We find that, on average, half to three-quarters of the E85 subsidy is passed through to consumers. However, pass-through takes 6–8 weeks, and station-level pass-through rates exhibit substantial heterogeneity, with the retailers’ market structure influencing both the speed and level of pass-through. © 2019 by The Association of Environmental and Resource Economists.

AB  - In this paper, we present a number of key numerical methods that can be used to study elongated particles in fluid flows, with a specific emphasis on fluidised beds. Fluidised beds are frequently used for the production of biofuels, bioenergy, and other products from biomass particles, which often have an approximate elongated shape. This raises numerous issues in a numerical approach such as particle-particle contact detection and the accurate description of the various hydrodynamic forces, such as drag, lift, and torque, that elongated particles experience when moving in a fluid flow. The modelling is further complicated by a separation of length scales where industrial flow structures that can extend for many metres evolve subject to solid-solid and solid-fluid interactions at the millimetre scale. As a result, it is impossible to simulate both length scales using the same numerical approach, and a multiscale approach is necessary. First, we outline the direct numerical simulation (DNS) approach that may be employed to estimate hydrodynamic force closures for elongated particles in a fluid flow. We then describe the key aspects of a CFD-DEM approach, which can be used to simulate laboratory scale fluidisation processes, that must be addressed to study elongated particles. Finally, we briefly consider how current industrial-scale models, which concretely assume particle sphericity, could be adapted for the simulation of large collections of elongated particles subject to fluidisation. © 2019 The Author(s)

AB  - Technological solutions that allow to reduce the volume of wastes, determine the possibility of development of not only the technology or the company itself, but also environmental parameters that provide potential economic benefits. The relevance of the research consists in the investigation of the degree of quality of possible application of modern technologies of processing organic wastes with extraction of useful products. The objective of the research is the search of methods of cost reduction of the development of mobile plants for the production of biogas. The authors showed the technological structure of proposed solutions, develop the mathematical model, as well as justify the economic benefits as the prospect of application of the resulting model in mass production. The novelty of the research consists in the fact that this approach investigates the flow of organic wastes and their conversion into biogas, and thus into biofuel component, by using biologically active components, which allows to reduce potential damage to the environment almost to zero. It was demonstrated that this method may resolve the issue of accumulated organic wastes in near future. © 2019 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - This study presents an overview of the context and global impacts of recent International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations on the marine fuel oil refining industry, future marine fuel mix and ship emissions. IMO limited marine fuel sulphur content in both Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs) and Nitrogen Oxide Emission Control Areas (NECAs) to 0.1% (wt. %) by 2015, and to 0.5% globally by 2020. It is anticipated that the newly implemented IMO regulations will help to mitigate negative impact of ship emissions on public health and environment. IMO regulations require significant changes to refineries to increase the production of low sulphur fuels through a shift to distillates, use of novel deep desulphurization techniques, or fuel blending. Changes to the refinery processes can bring forth increases in greenhouse gas emissions and high capital investments. Alternative fuels will need to meet the required reduction of air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions in coastal areas. Alternative marine fuels consisting of liquefied nature gas (LNG) and biofuel may be suitable fuels to meet both targets. These two fuels are predicted to account for 50% of shipping energy demand by 2050, while the remainder will still be supplied by conventional heavy fuel oil (HFO)/marine gas oil (MGO). Switching to low sulphur fuels as a results of the new IMO regulations has led to measureable reductions in ship emissions generally. This fuel switching also resulted in changes in engine emission characteristics, especially on particulate matter chemical composition. © 2019

AB  - Domestically produced biofuels may help to reduce dependence on imported oil for powering transportation and infrastructure in the future. In this report, we reacted medium-chain and long-chain fatty anhydrides (capric, caprylic, lauric, and palmitic) with furfuraldehyde by the Perkin condensation to produce 2-n-alkenylfurans. In the second step, the 2-n-alkenylfurans were hydrogenated to form 2-n-alkyltetrahydrofurans. Basic fuel property testing (melting point, density, kinematic viscosity, derived cetane number, and calorific value) of the 2-n-alkyltetrahydrofurans indicates they are potentially useful as fuels for diesel engines. The mixture composed of 2-octyl- and 2-decyltetrahydrofuran had the best combination of fuel properties including a low melting point (−39 °C), high cetane number (63.1), high flash point (98.2 °C), and low viscosity (2.26 mm 2 s −1 , 40 °C), which compares favorably with specifications for diesel #2 and biodiesel.

AB  - Food price and land use data over an extended time period have been examined to identify possible correlations between biofuel production and food price or land use changes. We compared the food price index before and after the biofuel boom in the 2000s to evaluate biofuel's impact on the inflation rate. We found that the U.S. food price inflation rate since 1973 could be divided into three distinct regions. The inflation rate was lowest at 2.6% during 1991–2016, which encompasses the biofuel boom. Among many factors, continuously rising food production per capita was identified as the likely cause of low food price inflation during this period. The US exports of corn have not declined since the 1990s and soybean exports are rising at a steady rate. Among several variables tested as a cause of food price index increase, crude oil price had the highest correlation. We also manually verified the automated land use classification of satellite image covering 664 km2 in three selected areas in the US. We found that 10.90% of non-agricultural land was misclassified as agriculture, whereas only 2.23% of agricultural land was misclassified as non-agricultural. The automated classification showed an 8.53% increase in agricultural land from 2011 to 2015, while the manual classification showed only 0.31% (±1.92%) increase. This result was within the margin of error alluding to no significant land use change. We concluded that automated satellite image land use classification should be verified more rigorously to be used for land use change analysis. © 2019

AB  - This work studies the impact of using n-butanol or ethanol in blends with diesel fuel (extenders) on combustion, cyclic irregularity, and exhaust emissions trade-off (balance). Experiments were conducted at two speeds and three loads in a fully-instrumented, six-cylinder, four-stroke, heavy-duty direct injection (HDDI), turbocharged, ‘Mercedes-Benz’ bus diesel engine. Measured combustion chamber pressures and their heat release rate diagrams provide motivating features of the combustion process. Since low-ignition quality fuels as ethanol and n-butanol may instigate unstable engine operation, this work centers also into the examination of cyclic combustion variations (irregularity) strength as mirrored in the cylinder pressure diagrams, by analyzing for maximum pressures and mean effective pressures, employing statistical analysis tools for averages and coefficients of variation. The n-butanol or ethanol diesel fuel blends present stronger cyclic variations than the corresponding neat diesel fuel cases, with the ethanol ones being a bit stronger for the same value of fuel-bound oxygen. The above results and the different physical and chemical properties of biofuels assist the elucidation of engine stability differences, as well as the balance of all measured regulated exhaust emissions: smoke, nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and unburned hydrocarbons (HC). Defeat of smoke-NOx and CO-HC adverse trade-offs is revealed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - For the current research work, New Zealand origin sheep skin fat (NOSSF) with 7% free fatty acid (FFA) content was chosen for biodiesel production. The response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the acid catalyzed esterification of NOSSF. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed methanol to NOSSF mole ratio as an important parameter for the acid esterification reaction. The p-value &lt; 0.05 and F-value = 401.18 showed that quadratic model is significant. NOSSB yield of about 92% was achieved, when the acid esterification was carried out with 0.5 wt% H2SO4, 18:1 methanol: NOSSF mole ratio at 65 °C for 4 h followed by alkali-catalyzed transesterification of NOSSE with 0.5 wt% NaOH, 6:1 methanol: NOSSE mole ratio at 65 °C for 2 h. The physicochemical properties of NOSSB-PBD blends were evaluated and were observed to be well within the limits of ASTM D765 standards. Among all the blends, the NOSSB20 blend, showed good performance in par with PBD fuel operation with respect to BTE, BP and BSFC at full load. NOSSB-PBD blends emitted less CO and HC but more CO2 and NOx emissions than PBD. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Global palm oil production has greatly increased in recent years with the adoption of renewable energy policies by the E.U. and U.S.A. and growing demand for its use in food, biodiesel, and other commodities. Indonesia, the world's largest oil palm producer, has leased large tracts of forested and tribal lands as new concessions, thereby expanding oil palm plantations. While previous studies have focused on some of the important social and environmental consequences of this process, the full suite of potential environmental impacts from land conversion and cultivation remains poorly understood. Here we quantify these impacts in terms of forest loss and fragmentation, CO2 emissions from land use change, and freshwater pollution from fertilizer application. Within all concession types, forest cover decreased by 20% and forest fragmentation increased by 44%, both of which are significantly higher than in comparable non-concession areas. We also assess to what extent CO2 emissions and freshwater pollution are attributable to increasing palm oil demand abroad. We find that four-fifths of Indonesia's palm oil production is for export markets and that 66% of this is destined for just eight countries – India, China, Pakistan, Malaysia, Italy, Egypt, Bangladesh, and the United Kingdom. Examining these multiple impacts highlights the importance of remote policies and consumption patterns in dictating local production decisions in a telecoupled world. This work demonstrates that - in order to be truly sustainable - bioenergy initiatives must ensure that adverse environmental impacts (and the demands that drive them) are reduced globally and not simply displaced elsewhere. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study describes a techno-economic analysis (TEA) to evaluate the feasibility of developing an electrofuel (eFUEL) system based on hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). The system is developed to make use of the carbon in the aqueous and gas phases of an HTL process as inputs for the production of renewable transportation fuels, supplementing those from the ‘traditional’ HTL pathway. An Aspen Plus® model of the eFUEL system is developed containing a partial oxidation gasifier (POX), a reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reactor, and a Fischer–Tropsch (FT) process. The combined HTL, upgrading, and eFUEL (Electro-HTL) system is designed with a capacity of 1000 tonne of organic matter per day as input. The electro-HTL system increases carbon efficiency to 84.81% and the plant's fuel mass yield by 69.2% (from a yield of 27.8 to 47.0%) compared to a stand-alone HTL and upgrading system. The TEA of the electro-HTL system shows a minimum fuel-selling price (MFSP) of 26.06 USD GJ −1 , with a carbon efficiency of 84.91%. A sensitivity analysis is performed identifying hydrogen as the key cost influence on the MFSP. The study shows that the incorporation of the eFUEL system decreases the MFSP by 8.9% compared to the standalone HTL and upgrading system. The price generated by the electro-HTL system is 1.5–2.2 times higher than the price of fossil gasoline. In conclusion, the study shows that the production of renewable drop-in fuels using the electro-HTL system is not only cost competitive with other alternative fuel processes, but also with fossil fuels. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - The use of microalgae as triacylglycerides (TAG) feedstock for biodiesel is a widely researched field in the development of new technologies. In order to underpin the potential of microalgal biodiesel as a possible substitute in the biofuel industry, more detailed data is therefore required on these aspects. This study assesses the growth, TAG accumulation, kinetics of dissolved nutrients and the quality of biodiesel and its blends from the marine diatom Navicula cincta grown in a photobioreactor, using seawater enriched with nutrients and soil extract. Acid-catalyst transesterification was tested for biodiesel production. This species presented during nutrient depletion: 1) a total lipid content of 49.7% of ash-free dry weight (AFDW) with neutral lipid (mainly TAG) as the dominant fraction (ca. 81.5% of total lipids), and 2) favourable fatty acids for biodiesel, such as palmitic acid (28%) and palmitoleic acid (46%). The yield of biodiesel (B100) derived from diatom N. cincta (B NC ) and analysed by Gas Chromatography was 97.6% of FAME, being the FAME composition similar to the fatty acid profile of N. cincta neutral lipids. The fuel properties (including FAME percentage, cetane number, heat of combustion, color and sulfur content) of diatom blends prepared with petrodiesel in a 7% (B7 NC ) and 10% (B10 NC ) vol ratio were evaluated using a PetroSpec (PAC) and compared with commercial soybean blends (B7 S and B10 S ). B7 and B10 derived from N. cincta met the requirements of ASTM D6751 and presented improved cetane numbers (50.2 and 51.6, respectively) with respect to soybean blends. Furthermore, biodiesel derived from the studied species showed the lowest sulfur content (0.0056% w/w). The rapid accumulation of neutral lipids in response to natural nutrient deficiency in N. cincta and its capacity of autoflocculate are good selling points for the use of this microalga in the biofuel industry. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A new procedure is described for the development of photometers that operate in the NIR spectral region. The instrument was based on a set of LEDs as radiation source and associate interference filters (IF) to narrow the selected wavelength. The procedure involves obtaining the spectra using a FT-NIR spectrophotometer from a sample set that has spectral variations of a given analyte concentration. Based on the combined LED/IF spectral bandwidths, the high resolution FT-NIR spectra were processed to obtain a deresolved data set with lower resolution. Multiple Linear Regression combined with a variable selection method were used to select the most significant variables, among those present in the deresolved spectral data, to quantify a desired analyte. The optimized calibration results employing these selected variables guided the choice of how many LEDs and which IFs should be used in the photometer. In order to demonstrate the proposed procedure feasibility, a photometer was built to quantify biodiesel content in diesel. Seven pairs of LED/IF were selected for the photometer, which were chosen according to the selected variables by the proposed procedure. In addition, lenses were used to conduct the LED/IF pulsed radiation to a single photodiode detector. The pulsed LED protocol allows the use of Sequential and Hadamard matrix-based multiplexing methods for spectral data acquisition. The results obtained for biodiesel content ranging from 0.50% to 20.00% blended with diesel and vegetable oil presented a RMSEP of 0.53% v/v, LOD range of 0.23%–0.55% v/v, and R 2 of 0.99. These results show that the selected variables are not affected by the vegetable oil, a compound with very similar chemical (and spectral) characteristics to the fatty acid esters (biodiesel). The performance reached with the photometer was in accordance with that recommended by the National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP), which regulates and monitors fuel quality in Brazil. © 2019

AB  - A mathematical model was developed based on data obtained on Fischer-Tropsch (FT) laboratory scale unit operated in steady state, belonging to BIOENERGY 2020+ GmbH, Austria to demonstrate alpha-parameter dependence on carbon number. The lab-scale unit processed the synthesis gas, obtained by the gasification of biomass (woodchips), to produce liquid fuels for transportation applications. The FT reaction took place in a slurry reactor filled with dispersed cobalt-based catalyst. The products were then separated by partial condensation depending on their boiling points. The final output of the FT laboratory scale unit comprised three product streams – wax, diesel and naphtha. The reaction and separation of products were simulated in Aspen Plus software. The mathematical model used kinetic description based on power-law rate equations. The modeled product selectivity was controlled using an alpha-parameter of the Anderson-Schulz-Flory distribution. Because of the significant deviation of products spectrum from typical Anderson-Schulz-Flory distribution, a modified description of reaction selectivity was developed. The description introduces variable alpha-parameter, dependent on number of carbon atoms in the reacting molecule. The mathematical model developed using MATLAB software considered the production of aliphatic paraffins having a number of carbon atoms from C1 to C60. The mathematical model of simulated lab-scale unit comprised an ideally mixed reactor RCSTR and three FLASH2 separators for the separation of desired products. The results from mathematical model were validated by a comparison with experimental results from FT lab-scale unit. The modified polynomial dependency of alpha-parameter on carbon number showed significantly better description of composition and amounts of FT products, especially for wax stream where the description using constant alpha led to enormous deviations. Such better prediction of composition and amounts of acquired products is important for evaluating efficiency of further upgrading the FT products to liquid fuel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, a bio-oil model compound of walnut shell pyrolysis oil was selected. The microemulsions of diesel and model compound were produced using Span80 and Tween 80 as surfactants. The microemulsions were quantificationally analyzed to investigate the solubilization capacity of bio-oil characteristic components in diesel. The effects of surfactant concentration and initial volume ratio of bio-oil model compound to diesel (B/D ratio) on the solubilization capacity of bio-oil characteristic components in diesel were investigated. The heating value, kinematic viscosity, elemental analysis and thermogravimetric analysis of microemulsion were also conducted. Experimental results indicated that the suitable concentration of surfactant was 0.3 mol/L–0.45 mol/L, and the optimum B/D ratio was 4:12 for the bio-oil model compound. The dissolubility of m-cresol and guaiacol in microemulsion was much better than that of water and acetic acid. The heating value and the kinematic viscosity of microemulsion decreased slightly as the B/D ratio increased. Increasing the surfactant concentration contributed to a more pronounced increase in the kinetic viscosity and a significant decrease in the heating value. The influence of surfactant concentration on the fuel properties and thermogravimetric characteristics was stronger than that of B/D ratio. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, the production of bio-oil from the pyrolysis of furniture sawdust, waste lubricating oil and their mixtures were investigated under certain operating conditions in the presence of lime and zeolites, by using a laboratory scale horizontal tubular reactor placed in a furnace. The main focus was to investigate the mutual effect of lime and commercial zeolite on the amount of the bio-oil production from furniture sawdust and waste lubricating oil. The selected operating parameters were pyrolysis temperatures and heating rate of 300°C and 650°C and flash heating or gradual heating rate (30°C/min). Additionally, three different additives were tested as catalysts; namely, lime (CaO), commercial zeolite (4A) and a natural zeolite (klinoptilolite). The amount of the produced bio-oil was analyzed by gas chromatography–flame ionization detector. The distribution of solid, liquid and gaseous products was determined for each operational condition. It was seen that the amount of the bio-oil was influenced by the amounts of sawdust and zeolite in the mixture. Experimental results showed that higher temperatures were more effective for the higher bio-oil amount. Additionally, heating rate was quite significant at 300°C whereas it has a minor effect on the bio-oil amount at 650°C. The highest bio-oil yield was obtained for the mixture of sawdust and waste lubricating oil in the presence of both lime and commercial zeolite with flash heating rate at 650°C. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Current biofuels for diesel engines are largely derived from food crops and there is significant concern, recognised by legislation, that such fuels do not result in net reductions of greenhouse gas emissions when considering the entirety of the production to usage lifecycle. A potential alternative approach is to utilise the lipid content of organic waste streams arising from food crop cultivation for the manufacture of sustainable diesel fuels. This paper therefore presents experimental studies carried out on a modern direct injection diesel engine supplied with a biodiesel (fatty acid methyl esters) produced from waste date pits to determine the combustion and emissions characteristics of an alternative fuel produced from a food residue. Date pit methyl esters were tested relative to both rapeseed and soybean methyl esters, unblended and as blends with a reference fossil diesel, alongside reference fossil diesel and a commercially available fossil diesel from Oman, at constant injection timing and constant ignition timing at a constant engine speed of 1200 rpm. Gas chromatograph analysis of the methyl esters fatty acid composition found a significantly shorter mean alkyl moiety chain length and lower number of double bonds in the case of the date pit esters than either the rapeseed or soybean biodiesel. All of the methyl esters exhibited a similar duration of ignition delay less than that displayed by a reference fossil diesel, but with a higher premixed burn fraction and peak heat release rate in the case of date pit methyl esters relative to those of rapeseed and soybean. Exhaust emissions of NOx were found to be lowest for the unblended date pit methyl esters, suggesting a greater influence of adiabatic flame temperature on rates of thermal NOx production than global in-cylinder temperatures in the case of the unblended methyl esters. Relative to the reference fossil diesel and Oman diesel, all of the methyl esters tested resulted in low particulate matter emissions. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Waste cooking oil (WCO) can be used as an energy source to reduce fossil fuel consumption; however, WCO has high viscosity which restricts direct use in diesel engines. Emulsification techniques can be employed for fuel preparation by selecting suitable surfactants and WCO, diesel and butanol or ethanol ratios using a pseudo-ternary phase diagram. Results indicated that a WCO-diesel fuel blend (WDF) with butanol required no surfactants for homogeneous phase blending compared to WDF with ethanol. Phase behavior of WDF-ethanol blends with hydrophobic surfactants was more suitable than WDF-ethanol blends with more hydrophilic surfactants. Kinematic viscosity of WDF blends depended on the amount of surfactant and its hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB) value. WCO content was determined as a significant factor contributing to WDF viscosity (p < 0.05). Biofuel blends containing 70% v/v diesel fuel, 15–20% v/v WCO, and 15–20% v/v ethanol with Dehydol LS1 or Span 80 at ethanol:surfactant ratio of 9:1 were selected for further analysis of relevant fuel properties. All selected WDFs gave emulsion droplet size at 200 nm or less. Other properties such as water content, carbon residue and copper strip corrosion met values specified by diesel and biodiesel fuel standards. Acid value of WDFs exceeded the standard due to high acid content of WCO. WDFs with ethanol/surfactants showed higher oxidative stabilities than WDFs with butanol. In terms of safety, conditions for storage and transport should be applied for WDFs because of their low flash point. WDFs obtained by this technique may be used in unmodified diesel engines but engine performance should be monitored. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The production of bio-fuels as a substitute for crude oil is steadily increasing. The reactions producing bio-fuels need detailed analysis concerning mechanism and reaction kinetics to increase yield. Standard analytical methods provide a way to monitor the reaction in real-time but detailing the mechanism through chemical shift fingerprinting is not possible using these methods. The reaction kinetics during biofuel production can be followed in real-time by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy by passing reaction mixture through the magnet. The present work reports the use of desktop NMR spectroscopy for a real-time study of the transesterification of triglycerides (vegetable oil) with methanol for formation of methyl esters (biodiesel) to detail catalytic activity, reaction mechanism and kinetics. The reaction was investigated for different catalyst concentrations, different molar ratios of reactants, and different temperatures. The changes in the chemical shift of the hydroxyl protons in the reaction mixture resulting from changing catalyst concentration and temperature provide information about the role of the catalyst in the aqueous and organic phases. The reaction was determined to be mass transfer controlled in the initial stage and kinetically controlled at later stage depending upon the reaction conditions. Analysis of the reaction for different molar ratios of oil and biodiesel and for increasing methanol concentration suggests the formation of dimers. The time variation of the methyl ester (bio-diesel) concentration was determined by partial least squares regression (PLS-R) using high-field NMR spectroscopy as reference. To obtain rate constants for each reaction the kinetics were modeled assuming fatty acid methyl esters as major product, and mono and diglycerides as intermediates. The 95% confidence intervals were derived by a Monte-Carlo analysis. The reaction kinetics are compared to those obtained by peak fitting of low-field spectra. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, production of biodiesel from palm oil mill effluent (POME) using immobilized Candida rugosa lipase was optimized using Box-Behnken design (BBD) of response surface methodology (RSM). The optimized parameters chosen were methanol/POME ratio, reaction time, weight of the immobilized beads and agitation speed. The highest yield of both palmitic acid methyl esters (PAME) and oleic acid methyl ester (OAME) was obtained at the following optimum conditions; agitation speed (300 rpm), oil/methanol molar ratio (1:6), incubation period (5 h) and weight of the immobilized beads weight (2 g). The important fuel properties of the biodiesel such as flash point, kinematic viscosity, water and sediment and copper strip corrosion were evaluated according to the American Society for Testing of Materials (ASTM D6751) and European Standard (EN 14214) and were found to be in good agreement with the standard quality and specification. © 2018

AB  - This work describes the characterization of esters derived from waste frying oil, sewage scum, and domestic fat trap residue. The innovative aspects of this work include the use of domestic fatty residues, study of the influence of the gas chromatography injection conditions on correct determination of the esters content, and the use of deactivated silica to purify esters from alternative sources in order to be able to classify them as biodiesel. Thermogravimetric analyses of the samples showed mass losses characteristic of evaporation and ester decomposition, which could be correlated with the esters content. Infrared spectra showed no significant OH, indicative of low acid values. The esters contents were determined by gas chromatography, with C17:0 and C18:1 esters as external standards, in accordance with the EN 14103:2003/2011 and NBR 15764:2015 methodologies. Better responses for the quantification of esters content were achieved using a PTV injector, rather than an isothermal injector, and heptane as the solvent in the analysis. The initial esters contents of the materials were between 86 and 98%. Deactivated silica was used as an adsorbent to remove undesirable contaminants, so that the esters contents of the samples complied with the minimum value required by legislation (&gt;96.5%). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Currently, triacylglycerides (TAG) accumulation in the form of lipid droplets (LDs) in oleaginous microorganisms is of immense importance due to their ability to get transesterified into value-added products in the form of biodiesel. Hence, in order to search for oleaginous microorganisms having high lipid content among a wide range of samples from different niches, there is a compulsive need to develop simple, reliable and rapid methods for screening of TAG accumulating strains. Conventional methods require multistep processes for the isolation, cultivation, extraction and estimation of lipids to identify oleagenic strains. To overcome these challenges, we are proposing an easy, live cell imaging technique for the estimation of lipids via visualization of TAG accumulation in probable strains at the single cell level that gives real-time monitoring of intracellular lipid accumulation in yeasts. In this screening technique, only 100 μl of specific neutral lipid accumulating medium was used to grow the isolated culture in the microtiter plate. The harvested cells were stained with LipidTOX™ Green and visualized by a LED based digital inverted fluorescence microscope. Among 446 yeast colonies screened, maximum lipid producing yeast strains Rhodosporidium kratochvilovae HIMPA1 and Rhodotorula minuta, having supersized lipid body of 5.05 ± 0.87 μm and 4.46 ± 0.61 μm, respectively, were identified as potential candidates for biodiesel production. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of using LipidTOX™ Green for the staining of lipid droplets present in yeast cells as per the literature. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A novel solid Lewis acid catalyst F−-SO42-/MWCNTs was prepared by impregnating multi-walled carbon nanotubes with sulfuric acid and NaF solution. It was characterized by several techniques. Catalytic activity of F−-SO42-/MWCNTs was evaluated in the esterification reaction of oleic acid and methanol. It exhibited high catalytic activity, giving an oleic acid conversion of 90% when the reaction was conducted with 0.9 wt% catalyst and a methanol/oil molar ratio of 12:1 at 65 °C over 6 h. A kinetic study of F−-SO42-/MWCNTs catalyzed esterification reaction of oleic acid and methanol was implemented after reaction conditions have been optimized, and it was described by the reversible pseudo second-order reaction rate law. Kinetic constant was correlated with the molar ratio of methanol to oleic acid, catalyst concentrations and reaction temperature. Pre-exponential factor (A) and activation energy (Ea) of the positive and reverse reactions of the F−-SO42-/MWCNTs-catalyzed esterification were obtained. The values of A and Ea of the forward reaction were 1.88 L mol−1 h−1 and 32.73 kJ mol−1, and the values of the reverse reaction were 1.90 L mol−1 h−1 and 32.61 kJ mol−1, respectively. The biodiesel product obtained in this study meet the requirements of the ASTM D6751 standard. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, initially, n-butanol at low proportions viz. 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% is blended with Karanja methyl ester (KME) respective proportions, and the blends are characterized. The blends are denoted as KBB5, KBB10, KBB15 and KBB20 where the numeric value followed by KBB indicates the percentage of n-butanol in the blends. The blends are used as test fuels in a single cylinder, four-stroke, direct injection (DI) diesel engine producing power of 4.4 kW at a constant speed of 1500 rpm. The combustion, performance and emission characteristics of the engine are evaluated and compared with the diesel engine operation. Further, an oxygenated additive: diethyl ether (DEE) in small quantities is added with the optimum blend to examine the reduction of unburnt hydrocarbon (UHC) emission from the engine when it is run with a biodiesel n-butanol blend. Among all the four KME n-butanol blends examined in this study, KBB15 exhibits good performance and less emissions. The results are presented in this paper. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Environmental concerns in fossil fuel depletion intensified the search for alternate fuel from renewable resources. The focus of this study is to produce biodiesel from low-grade cooking oil by using Cu/Zn/γ-Al2O3 as bi-functional heterogeneous base catalyzed transesterification reaction. The investigation of Cu/Zn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst on the calcination temperatures, dopant ratios to zinc oxide based and number of alumina coatings had significantly affected the catalytic performance. The physicochemical properties examined by XRD, XPS and TEM analyses over Cu/Zn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst indicates polycrystalline structure dominated by cubic Al2O3, hexagonal ZnO and monoclinic CuO species that presumably acted as active species which contributed to the catalytic transesterification of biodiesel. The design of experiments was performed using Box-Behnken design coupled with response surface methodology in order to optimize Cu/Zn (10:90)/γ-Al2O3 catalyst preparation conditions. The experimental value achieved 88.82% production of biodiesel that closely agreed with the predicted value from RSM. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The traditional method of biodiesel production is based on the transesterification of triglycerides using an alkaline catalyst dissolved in methanol. The aim of this study was to replace a homogeneous alkaline catalyst with a heterogeneous catalyst on the carbon support. The use of a carbon enables the catalyst to be reusable in the production process, eliminates the formation of soaps and increases the glycerol purity. Fatty acid methyl esters were obtained from the transesterification of corn oil using KOH supported on activated carbon (KOH/AC). The effect of the molar ratio of methanol to oil, reaction time and catalyst amount were used to optimize the transesterification reaction. The optimum condition for waste corn oil transesterification to methyl ester was obtained below 0.75 wt.% catalyst amount. The yield was up to 92 wt.% at 62.5 °C, 1 h reaction time and 3:1 methanol-to-oil ratio. This study demonstrated that the transesterification of the waste corn oil using methanol can be effectively catalyzed by the developed catalyst. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Rapid population growth during the past decades has created a demand for clean energies as replacement for fossil fuels. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the ability of oleaginous fungus as a valuable feedstock in biodiesels production. Isolate ADH17 was selected as the most potent fungal isolate among 108 fungal isolates based on selective staining and lipid production. This isolate was identified as Sarocladium kiliense ADH17. Optimization of growth and lipid production using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) revealed that the highest lipid production could be obtained by 7 days incubation, initial pH of 5.5, 5.16% v/v glycerol and 1.3% w/v glucose concentrations. Optimization process resulted in 45 and 30% increase in growth and lipid production, respectively. Analysis of the extracted lipids showed that oleic (C18:1) (51%) and palmitic acids (C16:0) (35%) were dominant fatty acids. The prediction software showed that cetane number (58) and other parameters of the produced biodiesel met the European standard for biodiesel (EN 14214) requirements. Results from this study showed that S. kiliense ADH17 produced high amount of desirable fatty acids and since the obtained biodiesel met the required standards, this fungus is a promising species for biodiesel production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Increasing energy demands coupled with decreasing fossil fuel resources create an urgent need to switch over bio-based fuel, such as biodiesel. In a newly designed reactor, the production of biodiesel was conducted with soybean oil (SBO) in solvent-free system through transesterification by immobilized Burkholderia cepacia lipase under the influence of ultrasonic emulsification. Effects of operational parameters viz. methanol-to-oil molar ratio, water concentration, immobilized enzyme concentration, and temperature on fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) yield were investigated. Molar ratio and enzyme concentration showed a significant linear correlation with biodiesel yield (r = − 0.8 and 0.6; respectively). Linear regression analysis of both parameters later revealed a significant prediction ability for biodiesel with a yield of 78.8 and 31.7%, respectively. FAME yield was 30% at 7 h in the pretreatment reactor. Without ultrasonic emulsification, the yield was significantly enhanced to 64% for the same reaction time in the packed-bed reactor. However, the reaction time was further reduced significantly under the influence of ultrasonic emulsification coupled with immobilized lipase as a catalyst and resulted into higher biodiesel yield of 68.6% at 3 h. Clearly, ultrasonic emulsification-assisted immobilized lipase catalysis of SBO might be a potential alternative route to conventional methods of biodiesel production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is one of the best alternative to depleting fossil fuels for transport sector. However, biodiesel production via lipase mediated transesterification has limitation of high costing microbial enzymes. In order to overcome this limitation, a process of sequential treatment of oil industry wastewater using isolated lipolytic bacterial strains and biodiesel production from non-edible plant oils was studied. In this study, efficient lipase producing bacteria were isolated and evaluated for production of biodiesel from mustard, soybean, jatropha and taramira oils utilizing methanol for the transesterification of oils and bioremediation. Selected strains were then identified, using 16s rRNA sequencing. Further, Bacillus subtilis strain Q1 KX712301 was optimized for biodiesel production from non-edible taramira oil via Plackett–Burman and central composite design. Highest volumetric yield of biodiesel obtained was 102% at optimized parameters. Finally, a sequential bioremediation of vegetable oil contaminated wastewater and then microbial production of biodiesel from non-edible taramira oil was carried out using efficient lipase producer B. subtilis strain Q1 at optimized conditions. During sequential process, complete chemical oxigen demand reduction of oil containing wastewater and theoretical volumetric yield of biodiesel was achieved. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry chromatogram revealed that the total fatty acid methyl ester content of the produced biodiesel was >98% which is in accordance with the biodiesel quality standards specified by both ASTM and EU-14103. © 2018 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan

AB  - Utilizing lignin feedstock along with cellulosic ethanol for the production of high-energy-density jet fuel offers a significant opportunity to enhance the overall operation efficiency, carbon conversion efficiency, economic viability, and sustainability of biofuel and chemical production. A patented catalytic process to produce lignin-substructure-based hydrocarbons in the jet-fuel range from lignin was developed. Comprehensive techno-economic analysis of this process was conducted through process simulation in this study. The discounted cash flow rate of return (DCFROR) method was used to evaluate a 2000 dry metric ton/day lignocellulosic ethanol biorefinery with the co-production of lignin jet fuel. The minimum selling price of lignin jet fuel at a 10% discount rate was estimated to be in the range of $6.35–$1.76/gal depending on the lignin and conversion rate and capacity. With a production capacity of 1.5–16.6 million gallon jet fuel per year, capital costs ranged from $38.0 to $39.4 million. On the whole, the co-production of jet fuel from lignin improved the overall economic viability of an integrated biorefinery process for corn ethanol production by raising co-product revenue from jet fuels. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - The aviation sector's commitments to carbon-neutral growth in international aviation starting in 2020, and the desire to improve supply surety, price stability, and the environmental performance of aviation fuels, have led to broad interest in sustainable alternative jet fuels. Here, we use the system-dynamics-based biomass scenario model (BSM), focused on alternative jet fuel production capacity evolution, and the geospatially explicit Freight and Fuel Transportation Optimization Tool (FTOT), focused on optimal feedstock and fuel flows over the transportation system, to explore the incentive effects on alternative jet fuel production capacity trajectories and potential geospatial patterns of production and delivery in the USA. Scenarios presented here focus on readily available waste feedstocks (waste fats, oils and greases, municipal solid waste, and crop and forestry residues) and conversion technologies included in the ASTM D7566 synthesized aviation turbine fuels specification. The BSM modeling of possible deployment trajectories from 2015 to 2045 suggests that up to 8 billion gallons may be available by 2045 depending on the policies and incentives implemented. Both approaches suggest that 200 million to 1 billion gallons per year of alternative jet fuel production are possible in 2030 given multiple incentives and a favorable investment climate, and that capital costs and technology maturation rates will affect deployment of different fuel production technologies, and therefore the feedstocks needed. Further collaboration on these modeling approaches would reduce methodological blind spots while providing insights into future industry trajectories. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - This work examines the feasibility of fueling methyl ester derived from green algae species, Chlorella emersonii in a compression ignition engine. This work also proposes Chlorella emersonii methyl ester (CEME) as a potential alternative energy source since the above species is available extensively in freshwater, marine and aquatic ecosystems throughout the world. CEME was blended with petroleum diesel fuel at various volume proportions of 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 100% and their properties were analyzed as per ASTM standards for its application as biofuel. The prepared test fuels were analyzed experimentally in a single cylinder diesel engine at a constant speed (1500 rev/min) for its performance, combustion and emission (regulated and unregulated) characteristics. Test results indicated that, the characteristics of 20% CEME+80% DIESEL fuel blend was in par with neat DIESEL fuel in terms of thermal efficiency, THC (total hydrocarbon), CO (carbon monoxide) and smoke emissions. However, CEME blends resulted in slightly higher levels of CO 2 (carbon dioxide) and NO x (oxides of nitrogen) emissions. In terms of unregulated emissions, CEME blends in DIESEL showed lowered toluene and acetaldehyde emissions. However, acetone and formaldehyde emissions increased with higher percentage of CEME in DIESEL blend. At full load, the attained cylinder pressure and heat release rate of CEME were comparatively lower than DIESEL fuel. Overall, it can be concluded that B20 (20% CEME +80% DIESEL fuel) blend can be a positive variant feedstock and it can be utilized in an unmodified diesel engine with minimal tailpipe emissions. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This paper shows the direct comparison of 4 different catalysts (homogenous alkaline (KOH), heterogeneous alkaline (CaO), homogenous acid (H 2 SO 4 ) and a new biocatalyst (lipase from Thermomyces lanuginosus (TLL) immobilized on octadecyl methacylate)) in the production of biodiesel from cooking oils. The reactions for each catalyst were optimized using response surface statistical methodology, considering as main parameters: substrates molar ratio, percentage of catalyst and reaction time, whereas for enzymatic catalysis instead reaction time, we studied water concentration. Alkaline homogenous catalysis was found to be the most effective, as expected from literature. However, for first time, the new biocatalyst from TLL is just around one order of magnitude under the homogenous catalysis in reaction rate and surpassed the heterogeneous catalysis or the acid catalysis (similar yields in 2 h versus the 1 h of the alkaline catalyst). Moreover, the reaction product using the biocatalytic approach was much cleaner and less energy demanding than the other catalytic approaches. From our view, this is the first report where biocatalysis is close to conventional catalysis in the production of biodiesel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, neat castor oil having a high viscosity of 226.2 cSt is taken as a base fuel replacing diesel in a CI engine. To improve the combustion characteristics of NCO, various methods like transesterification, blending with diesel and blending with low viscous biofuel namely pine oil (P) were adopted. Pine oil has viscosity of 1.3 cSt, which is only about 1/3rd compared to diesel fuel. On the contrary, low cetane number of pine oil limits its share ratio (30% by volume) due to engine knocking problems. The merits and demerits of the properties of castor oil and pine oil are mutually balanced causing a NO-smoke tradeoff. For comparison purpose, diesel was blended 30% by volume with NCO. All the tests were done in a single cylinder CI engine with rated power of 5.2 kW at 1500 rpm. Diesel, neat castor oil (NCO), castor oil methyl ester (COME), NCO70 + P30 and NCO70 + D30 were tested to assess the comparative performance, emission and combustion characteristics at different load conditions. NO emission for diesel is 8.2 g/kWh and for NCO and COME it is 5.2 g/kWh and 8.99 g/kWh respectively. The smoke opacity is 57% for diesel and it exceeds 100% for NCO at full load whereas it is 69% for COME. NCO70 + P30 blend increases NO emission to 7.1 g/kWh and reduces smoke opacity to 85% compared to neat castor oil. Very low viscosity and better volatility of pine oil, blending it with NCO improves brake thermal efficiency from 23.73% to 29.07% whereas it is 29.73% and 32.93% for COME and diesel operations respectively. While, COME exhibited better combustion compared to other techniques, considering NO-smoke tradeoff and laborious tranesterification process, NCO70 + P30 is considered optimum since the performance, combustion and emission characteristics approach closer to COME operation. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Purpose: Due to efforts to reduce dependence on limited fossil energy reserves and increasing GHG emissions related to fossil fuel extraction and use in transportation vehicles, renewable fuel use is growing rapidly. By adding renewable oxygenated fuel additives such as oxymethylene ether (OME) to conventional diesel, combustion GHG emissions can be reduced significantly without modifications to vehicle engines. However, life cycle sustainability assessments (LCSA) of OME production and its use with diesel are scarce. The objective of this paper is to develop an LCSA model of OME production from forest biomass to be used in vehicles as a diesel additive. Methods: This study conducts an LCSA of OME production from two types of forest biomass as feedstock, whole tree and forest residue. A framework was developed to assess environmental, economic, and social impacts of unit operations along the life cycle for a functional unit of 1 MJ of heat produced from OME. Then, PROMITHEE (Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment and Evaluation) was used to rank and select the best sustainable pathway for OME production and the most sustainable OME-diesel blend based on a number of indicators. Results and discussion: Based on the sustainability assessments results, the forest residue pathway is found to be more sustainable than the whole tree pathway. In addition, the environmental, economic, and social impact results for different OME-diesel blends show that a blend of 10% OME in 90% diesel is the most sustainable fuel mix. Assuming that the GHG emissions from biofuel combustion are offset by CO2 sequestered during plant growth, the biomass production operation contributes the highest global GHG emissions in the OME life cycle; this is due to the high energy intensity of harvesting operations for both pathways (13 gCO2eq/MJ for whole tree and 7.13 gCO2eq/MJ for forest residue). OME production costs are higher for the whole tree (1.92 $/L) than the forest residue pathway (1.71 $/L). All the social indicators (i.e., employment potential and employee wages and benefits) are more favorable in the forest residue pathway. Conclusions: We conducted sensitivity analyses by varying parameters such as sustainability impact weights, threshold values, and indicator impact values. We then determined the parameters’ impacts on overall ranking to verify the robustness of the model. This model can be used to assess and rank other energy technologies that integrate environmental, economic, and social sustainability impacts and thereby contribute to policy-making for the energy industry. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Aviation CO 2 emissions are growing along with traffic growth and expected technological efficiency improvements are not enough to reduce this continuous increase. International organizations are concerned and are implementing incentive rules in order to reduce them. IATA has stated a carbon neutral growth of emissions from 2020 onward within its roadmap. This paper aims to analyze suitable measures that could help to reach this target and focuses on their impact on the finances of 15 varied Spanish airlines. With these goals, an estimation model is designed in order to carry out a forecast of the 2017–2025 Spanish air market. This is comprised by three submodels: (i) the traffic model estimates the annual performance for Spanish carriers in each of their routes, (ii) the biofuel model is in charge of estimating the biofuel prices, emissions and regulations (with special attention to mandatory blending percentage), and (iii) the operating cost model estimates the carrier’s expenses structure. Data from several sources (regarding 2016 traffic statistics and forecasts of growth and fuel prices to name but two) is gathered and merged in order to feed the model. Aggregated results show that an average 3% per year increase of mandatory blending percentage should be applied for a 2020 CNG in the base scenario. Regarding the different biofuel feedstocks investigated, Camelina’s performance presents a good compromise in respect to price, emissions, and production issues. A further study on the airline’s cost structure shows that differences in the operating model (legacy, low cost, etc.) and route configurations can lead to big differences in terms of impact of biofuels introduction on the total airline costs. This could indicate that perhaps the design of distance-specific financial schemes would be desirable. In addition, high sensitivity to changes in common fuel price and traffic growth is observed. © IMechE 2018.

AB  - A series of high-performance cycloparaffinic fuels have been generated by [2+2] cycloaddition of the bio-derived alkenes 1-hexene, isoprene, and 1-pentene, catalyzed by a low-valent iron pyridine(diimine) complex [(MePDI)Fe(N2)2(μ-N2)] [MePDI=N,N′-(2,6-pyridinediyldiethylidyne)bis(2,6-dimethylbenzenamine)]. Reactions with 1-pentene and 1-hexene resulted in 85 % selectivity to 1,2-cyclobutanes, and 12 % selectivity to acyclic alkenes generated by β-hydride elimination. Self-dimerization of isoprene was sluggish and generated heavier oligomer products, but cross-dimerization of isoprene with 1-hexene afforded primarily a 1,3-cyclobutane product, along with isomers of acyclic C11 mixed dimers. Hydrocarbon mixtures were hydrogenated and fractionally distilled to yield finished fuel mixtures in overall yields of 83–93 % at the multigram scale. The fuels exhibited densities ranging between 0.767 and 0.783 g mL−1, and net heats of combustion (NHOC) of up to 120.6 kBtu gal−1 (43.8 MJ kg−1). These values are higher than conventional synthetic paraffinic kerosenes owing to the higher density and ring strain afforded by the cyclobutane rings. The fuel mixtures also exhibited extremely low viscosities ranging from 2.38 to 4.78 mm2 s−1 at −20 °C, due in part to the presence of the acyclic dimers. The excellent fuel properties of the product mixtures, selectivity for dimer products, high yields, and the ability to use simple bio-derived alkenes as substrates, make the [Fe]-catalyzed [2+2] cycloaddition of unactivated alkenes a compelling route to the synthesis of sustainable high-performance fuels. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Furfural is a promising renewable platform chemical that is widely produced from lignocellulosic biomass and has received significant attention as a sustainable precursor for the production of chemicals and fuels. To date, one-pot conversion of furfural with cellulosic ethanol is mostly limited to the synthesis of C5-C7 hydrocarbons, poising a challenge for the production of high-energy density fuel from biomass-derived compounds. In this study, we present gold nanoparticles supported over nickel oxide (Au/NiO) as robust catalysts for selective conversion of furfural to hydrocarbons. The catalysts present ∼92% furfural conversion with ∼81% selectivity toward the production of C7 and C9 hydrocarbons through a one-pot cascade reaction, viz., cross-aldol condensations in the presence of ethanol, O2, and K2CO3, followed by a hydrogenolysis process using H2(g). Results indicate the unprecedented production of C9 from furfural and ethanol is yielded via in situ cross-aldol condensation of 3-(2-furyl)acrolein, an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde that is evolved in the reaction medium. Analysis shows the promising catalytic performance of the Au/NiO composite for the furfural conversion can attribute with synergic effects at the interface of the Au nanoparticles and the NiO, offering potential active sites for the reaction. This study may provide new guidelines for design of efficient catalysts to transform bio-based platform compounds into biofuels with high energy density. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The synthesis of biodiesel using rubber seed oil by a transesterification reaction using cement clinker catalysts was studied. The mineral composition and morphology of both the catalysts were analysed using X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance studies were used to find the Fatty acid methyl ester content and various compounds of esters in the synthesised biodiesel, which showed an efficient conversion of rubber seed oil to biodiesel. The highest yield of 80% was obtained from calcium oxide catalyst (1.5 g) activated at 50°C with a methanol-to-oil ratio of 6:1. The highest yield of 70% biodiesel was obtained using a cement clinker catalyst (0.5 g) activated at 50°C with a methanol-to-oil ratio of 6:1. The significant physical properties of biodiesel flash point, acid value and saponification value were found, and the results are within the American standard test method (ASTM D6751) limits. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In order to reach the national target in the use of renewable energy in the transport sector, about 55% of the biodiesel consumed in Italy is imported. However, imported biofuel is currently debated since large-scale production has entailed different environmental and socioeconomic problems. Sustainability in biofuel production is a priority for the European Union and with the new Common Agricultural Policy 2014–2020 (CAP) this priority could become an opportunity through access to aids for the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices. Considering the importance to promote small-scale biofuel production, this study aimed to assess the economic feasibility of rapeseed straight vegetable oil (SVO) use as a self-supply agricultural biofuel in Italian context, assuming that rapeseed is cultivated by using practices of conservation agriculture. The financial support of the new CAP was considered, and alternative hypotheses were assumed to promote the SVO supply chains. The economic analysis shows that EU aids can help to promote inland biofuel production, ensuring positive profits for farmers (with a net present value up to 181 thousand €), thereby reducing the risk connected to investments, mainly due to the fluctuation of some key variables, like diesel price. Moreover, results highlight the importance of establishing farmers’ associations: given the high cost of the initial investment, the absence of an agreement for the creation of an optimum-sized supply chains might make those investments non profitable. Agricultural policy is therefore helpful to promote sustainable biofuel production, making the supply chains independent and self-sufficient over time. In this context, to ensure a sustainable biofuel production, beside the provision of support to the initial investments, it is also important to consider in the future biofuel policy scenario the possibility to incentive energy crop cultivation by promoting conservation agricultural practices (e.g., crop diversification, crop rotation, minimum tillage). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Around 1% of waste cooking oil (WCO) is currently recycled to make biodiesel in Brazil, mainly because used oils can acquire physicochemical characteristics that render them unsuitable as raw materials. To make biofuel production from waste oils and fats more efficient and economically feasible, it is important to develop simple, rapid, and low-cost methods for testing the quality of WCOs. With the objective of establishing the applicability of stochastic modeling of e-nose profiles in assessing the suitability of WCO for biodiesel production, the synthesized biodiesel samples from 36 pre-used frying oils, obtained from domestic and commercial premises, were analyzed regarding ester content, acidity index, density, viscosity, and iodine index. Olfactory profiles of the WCO sources were obtained using a Cyranose chemical vapor-sensing instrument and interpreted by application of stochastic modeling and quadratic discriminant analysis. The predictive model obtained by stochastic analysis exclusively from the olfactory profiles of the samples of WCO allowed the latter to be classified according to their ability to generate biodiesel that would be compliant with standard specifications and with an overall accuracy greater than 80%. Our results demonstrated that stochastic modeling is a promising tool for predicting the quality of biodiesel based only on the WCO olfactory profiles and its origin, since it allows qualitative assessments of the principal biodiesel properties and eliminates the need for complex and time-consuming laboratory tests. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

ADO catalyzes a difficult and unusual reaction in the conversion of aldehydes to hydrocarbons and has been widely used for biofuel production in metabolic engineering; however, its activity is low. A comparison of the amino acid sequences of highly active and less active ADOs will elucidate non-conserved residues that are essential for improving the hydrocarbon-producing activity of ADOs. Results: Here, we measured the activities of ADOs from 10 representative cyanobacterial strains by expressing each of them in Escherichia coli and quantifying the hydrocarbon yield and amount of soluble ADO. We demonstrated that the activity was highest for the ADO from Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 (7942ADO). In contrast, the ADO from Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421 (7421ADO) had low activity but yielded high amounts of soluble protein, resulting in a high production level of hydrocarbons. By introducing 37 single amino acid substitutions at the non-conserved residues of the less active ADO (7421ADO) to make its sequence more similar to that of the highly active ADO (7942ADO), we found 20 mutations that improved the activity of 7421ADO. In addition, 13 other mutations increased the amount of soluble ADO while maintaining more than 80% of wild-type activity. Correlation analysis showed a solubility-activity trade-off in ADO, in which activity was negatively correlated with solubility. Conclusions: We succeeded in identifying non-conserved residues that are essential for improving ADO activity. Our results may be useful for generating combinatorial mutants of ADO that have both higher activity and higher amounts of the soluble protein in vivo, thereby producing higher yields of biohydrocarbons. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Soot emissions from aviation piston engines (APEs) are a major source of environment pollution in airport vicinity, stratosphere, and troposphere, and their nanostructure and surface chemistry play a critical role in determining the impact on human health and environment. In this work, the morphology and nanostructure of soot emitted from an aviation piston engine burning five different fuels including blends of promising alternative jet and biofuels were investigated via high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and Raman spectroscopy. The graphitic structures were observed by analyzing primary particles in the HRTEM images. Morphological analysis demonstrated that the separation distance of the graphene layers of soot particles from the kerosene-pentanol blend combustion was larger than that from kerosene-Fischer-Tropsch blend combustion, indicating that adding pentanol tended to generate particles with more loosely stacked layers and higher oxidation tendency. Raman results were in agreement with primary particle nanostructure analysis based on the HRTEM images. Furthermore, soot particles from different fuels exhibited different concentrations of amorphous carbon and structural defects. Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Camelina (Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz) seed oil has desirable properties for producing advanced biofuels and as a healthy cooking oil. It has been grown for centuries, but basic recommendations for nitrogen (N) fertilizer requirements are still needed to support widespread industrial cultivation across North America. A replicated N-response plot-scale study was conducted on a northern Mollisol soil for two growing seasons to 1) determine seed and oil yield, seed oil content, and vegetative response; 2) determine indices of N use efficiency; and 3) measure post-harvest residual inorganic soil N as an index of environmental risk. Seed and oil yield response to N fertilization was described with a quadratic function, which predicted maximum seed yield (1450 kg ha −1 ) and oil yield (580 kg ha −1 ) at about 130 kg N ha −1 . However, seed and oil yield did not differ significantly among N-rates above 34 kg N ha −1 . Seed oil content averaged 400 g kg −1 among all N rates. Agronomic efficiency declined above 34 kg N ha −1 , which coincided with an increase of post-harvest soil nitrate-N plus ammonium-N (residual N). Considering N use efficiency, simple cost analysis, and risk associated with residual N, a rate of 34 kg N ha −1 is recommended. © 2018, © This work was authored as part of the Contributor’s official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

AB  - The dual-fuel engines can be an interesting option for efficient supply of heat and power in combined heat and pow-er(CHP)systems,using a variety of both liquid and gaseous fossil fuels and biogenous fuels.Within the scope of the ongoing research at the Competence Center for CHP Technologies,two different dual-fuel configurations derived from the same base engine were tested with biomethane as gaseous fuel,using heating oil and various biofuels as pilot fuel.Procedure 1,referred to as”flexible dual-fuel mode”,featured a compression ratio of 19:1.Procedure 2,referred to as”pilot ignition mode”,featured a reduced compression ratio of 16:1;this configuration allowed for significantly higher biomethane ratios than Procedure 1,but limited the applicable liquid fuel quantities.Compared to Procedure 1(flexible dual-fuel mode),Procedure 2(pilot ignition mode)showed lower values of electrical efficiency under light load,identical values under medium load,and significantly better values at high loads.It allowed for the highest gas ratios combined with the best electrical efficiencies at full load and is thus the optimum configuration when gaseous fuels are to be used as primary energy source.In flexible dual-fuel mode,the best efficiency was reached in liquid fuel operation,while in pilot ignition mode,the best efficiency was obtained in dual-fuel operation with maximum share of gas.In both procedures,high electrical efficiencies of more than 42% could be achieved,along with power coefficients of about 1,which proves the good thermal efficiency and electrical efficiency of the investigated CHP engines. © 2019, Editorial Office of the Journal of Combustion Science and Technology.

AB  - Currently, the most important barrier in algal cultivation is growth nutrients cost. In the present study, the isolated alga Synechocystis PCC6803 was acclimatized under laboratory conditions using municipal wastewater and taken for large-scale cultivation in an open raceway pond. At the semi-continuous mode, the alga produced the highest biomass yield of 0.21 g L−1 d−1 and it was estimated that the algae could be able to produce 94.5 tones dry biomass ha−1 year−1. A low-cost study was conducted to harvest the maximum biomass recovery. The result shows that a combined use of iron (III) chloride and biopolymer enhanced the harvesting process and the maximum biomass recovery was achieved up to 98.7%. In addition, the biomass production cost was thoroughly explored, and it was estimated that the microalgae Synechocystis biomass production cost was approximately 2–3 US$ per kg of biomass. Meanwhile, to reduce the lipid extraction cost, a direct transesterification was performed using tungstated zirconia as a heterogeneous catalyst and the highest biodiesel yield of 90.5% was obtained. In addition, the biodiesel fuel properties were analyzed, and the results revealed that most of the fuel properties found within ASTM D6751 limits. Furthermore, the lipid extracted residues was explored for bioethanol extraction, and 0.186 g bioethanol/g residue was obtained. This is the first study to demonstrate the alga Synechocystis cultivation in an open raceway pond using municipal wastewater successfully and produced two potential biofuels. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this paper, complex processes of water droplet heat and mass transfer are analyzed in a cycle of condensing, transitional evaporation and equilibrium evaporation regimes during phase change which occurs on a droplet's surface. The dynamics of a heated droplet's surface temperature is directly related to the change in the regimes. The definition of the dynamics is based on a numerical iterative scheme which depends on the balance of a droplet surface's heat flux. In this scheme, the energy of phase change and external heat transfer are combined as well as the internal heat transfer occurring in droplets. The numerical investigation results of the water droplets' phase change were used as a basis while defining the inputs provided by the droplet slipping and the radiation absorbed in the flue gas within the interactions between the processes of complex transitional transfers. For this investigation, the conditions have been set to be typical for heat utilization technologies and biofuel furnaces used in flue gas removal. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this research work, the four ternary blends were prepared with 30% and 40% by volume of higher alcohol (decanol and hexanol) with biodiesel while maintain 50% of diesel concentration. All ternary blends of diesel-biodiesel-higher alcohols were used in single cylinder engine and the results were compared with binary blend of 50%–50% biodiesel, pure diesel and biodiesel. It was revealed that thermal efficiency of ternary blends was higher than biodiesel and in some cases it is closer to pure diesel. In contrary, specific fuel consumption is found to lower with increase in alcohol fractions in ternary blends. Moreover, hydrocarbon, smoke, carbon monoxide emissions from alcohol-infused fuel blends were observed to be lower than both biodiesel and pure diesel. Significant reduction in oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions was also observed by the addition of higher alcohols to the fuel blend when compared to biodiesel fuel. It is to be noted that decanol 40% addition with diesel and biodiesel blend has shown better results in emission characteristics. Furthermore, the heat release rate and in-cylinder pressure for biodiesel were significantly lower compared to pure diesel fuels. However, addition of 40% decanol with fuel blend improved the heat release rate and in-cylinder pressure. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present work aimed to explore the optimized conditions of hydrothermal co-liquefaction (co-HTL) of the green seaweed “Enteromorpha clathrata (EN)” and the lignocellulosic agricultural waste “rice husk (RH)”. Separate hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of EN and RH showed bio-oil yields of 26.0% and 45.6%, respectively. However, co-HTL under optimized conditions showed significant increase in the bio-oil yield by 71.7% over that of EN, and insignificant difference with that of RH. Nevertheless, the conversion ratio of co-HTL showed 10.6% significant increase over that of RH. GC-MS results showed that main compounds of EN and RH bio-oil lump into the C15–C20 and C5–C12 regions, mainly representing carbon range of diesel and gasoline, respectively. Short-chain (C5–C12) and long-chain (C14–C20) compounds in the bio-oil obtained by co-HTL represented 72% and 28%, respectively. In addition, the ratio of aromatic compounds in the bio-oil of RH was reduced by 9.3% as a result of co-HTL. In conclusion, results suggested 50% ethanol as a co-solvent, 300 °C and 45 min as optimum conditions for co-HTL of EN:RH (1:1 w/w). The present study demonstrated an efficient route for co-HTL of 3rd generation feedstocks with 2nd generation feedstocks which will have a significant impact on large-scale applications. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The objective of this work is to study the addition of n-pentanol with the Calophyllum Inophyllum biodiesel to evaluate the performance, emission and combustion characteristics. Five different fuel blends are prepared by varying the n-pentanol fraction (10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50%) on volume basis with biodiesel. The prepared samples are tested in single cylinder constant speed CI engine. The addition of n-pentanol with biodiesel improves the thermal efficiency of the fuel blend up to 30% as compared to pure biodiesel. Among all fuel samples, B90P10 blend has shown higher brake thermal efficiency as 27% which is slightly lower than BTE of diesel fuel. The brake specific fuel consumption of biodiesel-pentanol blends are increased from 4.2% to 27.3% when compared to diesel fuel (D100). However, addition of n-pentanol more than 40% shows a negative effect in terms of performance and combustion. It is noted that biodiesel and n-pentanol blends have shown 15–43% and 33–50% reduction in hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions compared to diesel. Further, the oxides of nitrogen and smoke emissions are found to be lesser for n-pentanol blends while comparing to the pure biodiesel. Among all blends, B90P10 is found to have better performance and emission characteristics. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Liquefaction is a promising technology for the preparation of bio-oil and biochar products from sewage sludge (SS). Co-liquefaction of SS and agricultural/forestry biomass is likely a potential method for obtaining high yield/quality of bio-oil and biochar. In this work, rice straw (RS) and wood sawdust (WS) were selected as representatives of agricultural/forestry biomass and the effects of main process parameters during the co-liquefaction of SS-RS/WS on the yields/properties of bio-oil and biochar were explored in details. The proper reaction temperature, solid-liquid ratio and reaction time for the co-liquefaction of SS-RS/WS were suggested to be 280–300 °C, 0.1 g/mL and 10–30 min, respectively. Potassium/sodium salt (-OH and -CO3) catalysts could efficiently enhanced the co-liquefaction of SS-RS/WS. The introduction of RS/WS into the liquefaction of SS would reduce the contents of nitrogen and sulfur in bio-oil and enhance the formation of phenolic compounds. In addition, co-liquefaction of SS-RS could promote the percentage of lower-boil-point compounds in bio-oil. Although the thermal stability, surface area and pore volume of biochars slightly decreased, the contents of organic matters in biochars were obviously improved, suggesting higher potential in land application. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The focus of this investigation is on biodiesel produced from juliflora seeds using the 2-stage acid transesterification process followed by alkali transesterification process producing 80% yield of Juliflra Oil Methyl Ester. Experiments were conducted on single cylinder diesel engine using juliflora biodiesel and its diesel blends. The experimental results of fuel blends (B20, B30, B40, and B100) were compared with those from diesel (D100). The results indicated the performance and combustion characteristics of B20 as almost in line with those of diesel fuel trend. Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC) for blends B20 and B30 (0.27kg/KWh) at full load was closer to diesel (0.26 kg/KWh). The BTE for Juliflora Biodiesel B100 is 31.11% and it was closer to diesel (32.05%) at full load. However the emission characteristics of CO, HC and smoke for biodiesel and its blends were smaller or equal compared to diesel throughout the experiment. At full load, the NOx for biodiesel B100 was 1832 ppm which was a little higher than diesel fuel (1821 ppm). This led to the conclusion of B20 being most suitable blend of other blends and it is substitute of diesel which will reduce diesel consumption by 20%. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is emerging as an important feedstock for biofuel production. Bioethanol is one of the most common liquid biofuels in the transportation sector. However, its production process is still inefficient due to the large quantity of production waste that is left unused after the distillation process. In this paper, the biomethane potential of bioethanol production waste is analysed. The results are compared with the biomethane potential of samples from different stages of the bioethanol production process (pretreatment, hydrolysis and fermentation), and that of untreated biomass. In this study, barley straw is used as a biomass crop and N2 explosive decompression (NED) is applied as a pretreatment method. The results show that bioethanol production waste has higher methane yields (1.17 mol CH4/100 g) than raw barley straw (1.04 mol CH4/100 g). Production waste also has a higher degradation rate (0.252) than untreated material (0.138), and achieves 95% of the maximum methane yield much faster (7.8 days) than untreated samples (22 days). This shows that production waste can be used for further anaerobic digestion (AD) to add value to the bioethanol production chain. NED pretreatment is an effective method of pretreatment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hazardous fires in fuel storage tanks may result in casualties of great impact. Efforts are being done to master the physics of the phenomena, aiming both avoidance and damage minimization. Flame characterization is an important approach studied by many researchers. This article presents the results of an experimental investigation of diesel oil (S500 type) pool fires under air crossflow conditions. A reduced scale model properly instrumented was tested in an aerodynamic channel. Measurement techniques include analysis of infrared images of pool fires, mass burning rates and flame geometry as a function of air crossflow velocity (which ranged from 0 m/s – quiescent air – to 4.0 m/s). Mass burning rates showed an oscillatory behavior as the crossflow velocity was raised. Regarding flame geometry, for an increasing air crossflow, firstly flame tilt angle increased, flame length decreased and flame height decreased until about 1.5–2.0 m/s, while after that velocity, flame geometry became nearly steady. Geometry results were also compared with thirteen correlations from literature for geometric parameters obtaining good agreement for some of them. The IR-measured temperatures showed that the flame region (reacting region) became hotter and the plume region (non-reacting region) became colder as the air crossflow velocity was increased. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - One of the barriers for the extended use of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) as a diesel fuel component is the yield of raw glycerol as a by-product of the transesterification process. In fact, glycerol is considered as one of the most abundant waste feedstock in the world. A new fuel denoted as FAGE (Fatty Acid Glycerol formal Esters) produced from glycerol and waste oil has been developed. FAME is concomitantly obtained during the manufacturing process of FAGE in different proportions depending of the reaction conditions. Since FAGE cold flow properties are in disadvantage when compared to FAME, the influence of some cold-flow improvers in FAGE/FAME blends has been investigated. In this work, the use of some acetals, co-products of the FAGE production process, are proposed as cold-flow improvers, giving extra value to this new fuel since all the co-products obtained from the production process would have a new industrial use. These two acetals are GF (Glycerol Formal) and GFOMOM (Methoxy-methyl glycerol formal). The results obtained show that cold flow properties become poorer when the amount of FAGE increases in the FAGE/FAME blend, but such effect is very slight up to 50% FAGE. The use of the acetals improves cold flow properties of the blends up to 2 °C, with minor effect of the GF content in the GF/GFOMOM acetal blend. In addition, a commercial cold flow improver was tested, improving the pour point and the cold filter plugging point with only small effect on cloud point and crystallization temperature. The results obtained from the acetals and the cold flow improver are compared, and the value of the acetals as cold flow improvers has been proved. A combination of both, acetals and cold-flow improver, is proposed as an optimal method to improve cold flow properties. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel is a promising replacement for petroleum based diesel in a number of different applications. Although biodiesel offers numerous advantages over petrodiesel, one of its major disadvantages is its inferior cold flow properties. Additives are often added to biodiesel to remediate issues with cold flow and other problematic properties. This work explored the feasibility of using compounds derived from bio-based sources as an additive for biodiesel. Specifically, the additive's efficacy in reducing the cloud point of model biodiesels was analyzed using differential scanning calorimetry. Each of the additives studied depressed the biodiesel cloud point, although most of the additives showed diminishing returns above a certain weight percent. For many of the additives, the mechanism of cloud point depression was found to be dilution. For these additives, their efficacy was hampered by self-association, a phenomenon confirmed by thermodynamic modeling. However, tripropionin and dimethyl azelate, molecules of similar size to the FAMEs in the biodiesel studied in this work, interfered with the development of a critical nucleus, causing more significant depressions in the cloud point. Overall, a thermodynamic model based on ideal solution theory was able to accurately predict cloud points for most mixtures studied. Large deviations were observed for systems with significant amounts of self-association and/or cocrystallization. © 2019

AB  - In modelling heating and evaporation of fuel droplets, intra-droplet heat and mass transfer has to be considered. This is only possible with the help of reliable data for thermal and mutual diffusivity. At present, research activities in connection with the modelling of the evaporation of fuel droplets are based on theoretical diffusivity data. For their check and validation, there is, however, a lack of reliable experimental data. In this study, a dynamic light scattering apparatus which was especially developed for the simultaneous determination of both thermal and mutual diffusivity for fuel-related mixtures is presented. In the apparatus, fuel-related mixtures can be investigated under defined conditions in the compressed liquid phase close to saturation conditions in macroscopic thermodynamic equilibrium. Model binary mixtures composed of five different substances representative for fuel-related compounds were investigated at temperatures up to 523 K and close to their bubble point line. In detail, the mixtures investigated in the present study include 9 of the 10 possible binary combinations of isopentane, isooctane, toluene, n-decane, and ethanol. The results document that even under extreme conditions, thermal and mutual diffusivities are accessible with average expanded uncertainties (k = 2) of 8% and 6%. For all systems, concentrations, and temperatures, the thermal diffusivity changes only slightly. In contrast, the mutual diffusivity varies by more than two orders of magnitude from about 10−10 to 10−8 m2·s−1. For mixtures of isooctane and toluene, the concentration dependency of the mutual diffusivity reveals a nonideal behavior which becomes more pronounced with increasing temperature. For all binary mixtures, the temperature dependency of the mutual diffusivity can be correlated well with the vapor pressure of the individual components. The presence of the biofuel ethanol strongly slows down the molecular diffusion process at low temperatures. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Developing a simple and efficient process for the conversion of biomass to petrol, diesel and jet fuels are our urgent mission due to the limitation of fossil fuels. Biobutanol is an important biomass-derived biofuel that can be converted to longer-chain petrol-range, diesel-range and jet-range fuels. Basing on the obtained concentrated acetone-1-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation broth through a prefractionator, we report a palladium-catalysed alkylation of acetone with ethanol and 1-butanol to more efficiently produce C5–C11 fuel precursors in a reactor, where all the precursors and reactants were separated simultaneously by the salting-out effect of K3PO4. The precursors include ketones and a small amount of alcohols that can be reduced to alkanes for use as liquid transportation fuels. Tuning the reaction conditions can obtain different proportions of C5–C7 products (monoalkylation) and C9–C11 products (double alkylation) and the overall product contents accounted for up to 82 wt%. More than 99.5% of water from the concentrated ABE fermentation broth was removed by the salting-out effect of K3PO4. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Increase in fossil fuel depletion and increase in fuel price forced the researchers to find an alternate source to petro fuel. The scope of this research article is to give an insight into the synthesis and utilization of catalytically cracked bio-oil in a DI diesel engine. The catalyst selection and its characterization are playing a vital role in cracking of bio-oil. The aluminum oxide catalyst is used in this study, because of its availability and cost. The properties of the catalyst were analyzed before and after cracking using SEM, EDAX and XRD. The catalyst pellets are placed in a fixed bed catalytic reactor where the jatropha oil is introduced to get the cracked gaseous fuel. The cracked fuel was tested with FTIR, TGA and DSC for finding its properties. From the results, properties of the cracked fuel are nearly matched with diesel fuel. The catalytically cracked jatropha biofuel (CCJB) is fumigated into the inlet manifold in the proportion of 10, 20 and 30% in specific fuel consumption of the diesel engine. The maximum brake thermal efficiency was observed for 30% of fumigated CCJB compared with diesel fuel. The exhaust emissions such as CO and smoke were considerably reduced when compared with diesel fuel. A significant increase in NO x emission than diesel can be seen for all operating conditions. © 2018, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to compare the performance, emission and combustion characteristics of E20 biodiesel with diesel-water emulsion and eucalyptus water emulsion. Design/methodology/approach: This research expounds the trans-esterification process apparently. Various biodiesel blends were made to go through the trans-esterification process to make it suitable for feeding them into the low heat rejection (LHR) engine. E20 biodiesel – 20% of eucalyptus oil by volume with diesel was chosen to carry out the research as it was found to be the best blend with diesel. The volume of water content in diesel water emulsions was varied by 5, 10 and 15% in DWM1 (Diesel Water Mixture1), DWM2 (Diesel Water Mixture2) and DWM3 (Diesel Water Mixture3), respectively. Similarly, the volume of water content in eucalyptus water emulsions was varied with emulsification ratio of E20 biodiesel. Partially stabilized zirconia was coated over top surface of the piston and valve facing of the LHR engine. Findings: From the researches carried out, DWM3 (Diesel Water Mixture3) was found to be superior when compared with other diesel-water emulsions in LHR engine. The overall efficiency was found to be higher for EWM3 than other biofuels tested the in LHR engine. Originality/value: This investigational experiment can be further extended to multi-cylinder engine and to improve the cetane number, Di ethyl ester (DEE) fuel additives can be added. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - A rapidly growing share of global agricultural areas is devoted to the production of biomass for non-food purposes. The expanding non-food bioeconomy can have far-reaching social and ecological implications; yet, the non-food sector has attained little attention in land footprint studies. This paper provides the first assessment of the global cropland footprint of non-food products of the European Union (EU), a globally important region regarding its expanding bio-based economy. We apply a novel hybrid land flow accounting model, combining the biophysical trade model LANDFLOW with the multi-regional input-output model EXIOBASE. The developed hybrid approach improves the level of product and country detail, while comprehensively covering all global supply chains from agricultural production to final consumption, including highly processed products, such as many non-food products. The results highlight the EU's role as a major processing and the biggest consuming region of cropland-based non-food products, while at the same time relying heavily on imports. Two thirds of the cropland required to satisfy the EU's non-food biomass consumption are located in other world regions, particularly in China, the US and Indonesia, giving rise to potential impacts on distant ecosystems. With almost 39% in 2010, oilseeds used to produce for example biofuels, detergents and polymers represented the dominant share of the EU's non-food cropland demand. Traditional non-food biomass uses, such as fibre crops for textiles and animal hides and skins for leather products, also contributed notably (22%). Our findings suggest that if the EU Bioeconomy Strategy is to support global sustainable development, a detailed monitoring of land use displacement and spillover effects is decisive for targeted and effective EU policy making. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Seasonal variation in microalgae production is a significant challenge to developing cost-competitive algae biofuels. Summer production can be three to five times greater than winter production, which could result in winter biomass shortages and summer surpluses at algae biorefineries. While the high water content (80%, wet basis) of harvested microalgae biomass makes drying an expensive approach to preservation, it is not an issue for ensiling. Ensiling relies on lactic acid fermentation to create anaerobic acidic conditions, which limits further microbial degradation. This study explores the feasibility of preserving microalgae biomass through wet anaerobic storage ensiling over 30 and 180 days of storage, and it presents a techno-economic analysis that considers potential cost implications. Results: Harvested Scenedesmus acutus biomass untreated (anaerobic) or supplemented with 0.5% sulfuric acid underwent robust lactic acid fermentation (lactic acid content of 6-9%, dry basis) lowering the pH to 4.2. Dry matter losses after 30 days ranged from 10.8 to 15.5% depending on the strain and treatment without additional loss over the next 150 days. Long-term storage of microalgae biomass resulted in lactic acid concentrations that remained high (6%, dry basis) with a low pH (4.2-4.6). Detailed biochemical composition revealed that protein and lipid content remained unaffected by storage while carbohydrate content was reduced, with greater dry matter loss associated with greater reduction in carbohydrate content, primarily affecting glucan content. Techno-economic analysis comparing wet storage to drying and dry storage demonstrated the cost savings of this approach. The most realistic dry storage scenario assumes a contact drum dryer and aboveground carbon steel storage vessels, which translates to a minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of $3.72/gallon gasoline equivalent (GGE), whereas the most realistic wet storage scenario, which includes belowground, covered wet storage pits translates to an MFSP of $3.40/GGE. Conclusions: Microalgae biomass can be effectively preserved through wet anaerobic storage, limiting dry matter loss to below 10% over 6 months with minimal degradation of carbohydrates and preservation of lipids and proteins. Techno-economic analysis indicates that wet storage can reduce overall biomass and fuel costs compared to drying and dry storage.[Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - The present work explores the production of isopropyl levulinate from furfural by a two-step microwave assisted cascade process. Furfural is a versatile biomass-derived industrial feedstock with high annual production volume. Alkyl levulinates are promising bio-based molecules with several applications in many sectors, in particular, as biofuels, blended with transportation fuels including biodiesel, these compounds can significantly reduce the formation of soot in engines. Thus, in the first step, the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol was studied employing a simply “ad hoc” synthesized magnetically recoverable Cu catalyst and 2-propanol as H-donor. Subsequently, the alcoholysis of the previously obtained liquors rich in furfuryl alcohol or of neat furfuryl alcohol solutions to isopropyl levulinate was investigated using commercial solid acid catalysts such as niobium phosphate and Amberlyst sulfonic resins (A15 and A70). The cascade process resulted feasible leading to good furfuryl alcohol yields in the transfer hydrogenation process with Cu-Fe3O4 magnetic catalyst using much lower Cu to furfural molar ratios than commonly reported. The subsequent alcoholysis step of furfuryl alcohol-rich liquors was highly efficient with A70 resin even in presence of unreacted furfural from the first step. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The low-lying valence excited states and Rydberg states of the radical species from the ring-opening reactions in pyrolysis of furan biofuels have been determined by extensive density functional theory and sophisticated wave function theory calculations. The radicals 1-C 4 H 5 O-2, 2-furylCH 2 , and 4-C 6 H 7 O with the delocalized π-type single electron are predicted to be most stable among the reactive species here for furan, 2-methyfuran, and 2,5-dimethylfuran, respectively. Predicted vertical transition energies by TD-CAM-B3LYP show good agreement with those by CASPT2. Some among the electronic excitations to low-lying states can take place in the visible light region, and they may be involved in the combustion process. Further surface hopping dynamics simulations on the excited states of the most stable ring-opening radical 1-C 4 H 5 O-2 of furan as an example reveal that 89.9% sampling trajectories at the initial excited state of 2 2 A”(π 1 π* 2 ) decay to the 1 2 A’(n 1 π* 2 ) state within an average of 384 fs, and then 81.2% trajectories at the 1 2 A’ state go to the ground state within an average of 114 fs. At the end of the simulation for 1000 fs, 18.8% trajectories still stay on the excited states of 2 2 A” and 1 2 A’, suggesting that the reactive radicals in the ground state are mainly responsible for the combustion chemistry of furan biofuels. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The reaction of ketene with hydroxyl radical is drawing growing attention, for it is found to constitute an important step during the combustion of hydrocarbon and oxygenated hydrocarbon fuels, e.g., acetylene, propyne, allene, acetone, gasoline, diesel, jet fuels, and biofuels. We studied the potential energy surface (PES) of this reaction using B2PLYP-D3/cc-PVTZ for geometry optimization and composite methods based on CCSD(T)-F12/cc-PVTZ-F12 for energy calculations. From this PES, temperature- and pressure-dependent rate coefficients and branching ratios at 200-3000 K and 0.01-100 atm were derived using the RRKM/ME approach. The reaction is dominated by four product channels: (i) OH addition on the olefinic carbon of ketene to form CH 2 OH + CO, which is the most dominant under all conditions; (ii) H abstraction producing HCCO + H 2 O, which is favored at high temperatures; (iii) OH addition on the carbonyl carbon to form CH 3 + CO 2 , which is favored at low pressures and high temperatures; and (iv) collisional stabilization of CH 2 COOH, which is favored at high pressures and low temperatures. With increasing temperatures, the overall rate constant k overall exhibit first negative but then positive temperature dependency, with its switching point (also the minimum point) at ∼400 K. Both product channel CH 2 OH + CO and HCCO + H 2 O are independent of pressure, whereas formation of CH 3 + CO 2 and collisional stabilization of CH 2 COOH are highly pressure dependent. Fitted modified Arrhenius expressions of the calculated rate constants are provided for the purpose of combustion modeling. Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The use of model bio-oil from pyrolysis biomass as a fuel was improved by forming diesel microemulsion using rhamnolipid (RL) as the surfactant. After microemulsification, synthetic bio-oil components were solubilized in different positions of the microemulsion. Water and some hydrophilic substances were solubilized in the hydrophilic core of the microemulsion, glyoxal, and vanillin in the palisade layer, and guaiacol in the diesel continuous phase. The bio-oil components species and their solubilization positions in the microemulsion fuel system had considerable effect on properties of the fuel, e.g., degradation/combustion characteristics as determined by thermogravimetric analysis. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The present study aims to analyze the oilseed production systems and costs for the production of biofuels in the North of Minas Gerais. The predominant cultivation system in the region is family farming, with little mechanization and intensive labor. Government programs that have been proposed in the region were also analyzed, such as the National Biodiesel Production Program (NBPP), along with analyses of the costs and the selling prices of each oilseed, as well as the productivity and planted area. According to the yield in kg feedstock/l of biodiesel, it is possible to verify the best alternative for the oilseed industry. For the rural producer, in accordance with the respective productivities, cost of production and crop prices, it is also possible to determine which of them provides the greatest return to the family farmer. On first examination, it was observed that the productivity of the region is in average according to the Brazilian reality, being cotton the only one below this average. Regarding the return of each oilseed to the industry, we observed that the best option would be castor bean, due to a lower kg/l (biodiesel) conversion rate and a low cost of production. As for the rural producer, in case the production is not destined to the biodiesel industry, the best alternative would be cotton due to its low cost of production, and its price level capable of bringing an excellent return to the producer. © 2019, Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco.

AB  - a major source of energy for our dynamic society is the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum and natural gas. These sources of energy have been found to have limited amounts available, and therefore are said to be depleting resources. Scientists are continuously looking to find alternatives to fossil fuels., One such alternative is using vegetable oils to make fuel. This is achieved by the replacement of petroleum by renewable energy i.e., biodiesel from ecosystems and agro ecosystems which represents a central strategy to mitigate and to adapt to climate changes and it is eco-friendly, renewable and more biodegradable. Biodiesel is a much better lubricant than petro-diesel and extends engine life. There are number of vegetable oils are available, like Jatropha carcass, Pongamea glabra, Salvalora oleo ides, Madhuca indicia, Azadiracta indicia, Piper nigram, castor, coconut, sunflower, ground nut, palm trees etc. But all these have their own medicinal values and other important uses rather than the production of biodiesel. So, while selecting the best one, it should be considered that such a raw material is to be selected which is abundantly available in all times at any place and which is not useful for other purpose rather than the production of bio-diesel. As the search for alternatives to fossil fuel intensifies in this age of modernization and industrialization, fueled by increasing energy costs, water hyacinth holds a strong promise in the 21st century biofuel industry. So, an attemp0074 was made to produce biodiesel from water hyacinth and to discuss technical, socio-economic, and environmental benefits of small scale biofuels such as improving energy access, creating additional sources and means for income generation and mitigating environmental pollution at both local and global levels. © 2019 IJSTR.

AB  - Biofuels have become an integral part of everyday life in modern society. Bioethanol and fatty acid methyl esters are a common part of both the production of gasoline and diesel fuels. Also, pressure on replacing fossil fuels with bio-components is constantly growing. Waste vegetable fats can replace biodiesel. Hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) seems to be a better alternative. This fuel has a higher oxidation stability for storage purposes, a lower temperature of loss of filterability for the winter time, a lower boiling point for cold starts, and more. Viscosity, density, cold filter plugging point of fuel blend, and flash point have been measured to confirm that a fuel from HVO is so close to a fuel standard that it is possible to use it in engines without modification. The objective of this article is to show the properties of different fuels with and without HVO admixtures and to prove the suitability of using HVO compared to FAME. HVO can also be prepared from waste materials, and no major modifications of existing refinery facilities are required. No technology in either investment or engine adaptation of fuel oils is needed in fuel processing. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Sustainable production of algae will depend on understanding trade-offs at the energy-water nexus. Algal biofuels promise to improve the environmental sustainability profile of renewable energy along most dimensions. In this assessment of potential US freshwater production, we assumed sustainable production along the carbon dimension by simulating placement of open ponds away from high-carbon-stock lands (forest, grassland, and wetland) and near sources of waste CO2. Along the water dimension, we quantified trade-offs between water scarcity and production for an 'upstream' indicator (measuring minimum water supply) and a 'downstream' indicator (measuring impacts on rivers). For the upstream indicator, we developed a visualization tool to evaluate algae production for different thresholds for water surplus. We hypothesized that maintaining a minimum seasonal water surplus would also protect river habitat for aquatic biota. Our study confirmed that ensuring surplus water also reduced the duration of low-flow events, but only above a threshold. We also observed a trade-offbetween algal production and the duration of low-flow events in streams. These results can help to guide the choice of basin-specific sustainability targets to avoid conflicts with competing water users at this energy-water nexus. Where conflicts emerge, alternative water sources or enclosed photobioreactors may be needed for algae cultivation. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Biomass-derived di-ethers, 2,5-bis(alkoxymethyl)furans (BAMFs), are currently envisaged as promising biodiesel or additives. Herein, Zr-SBA prepared by a urea hydrolysis method (Zr-SBA-UH) is used as a highly active bifunctional catalyst for the reductive etherification of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), and offers the 2,5-bis(isopropoxymethyl)furan (BPMF) yield up to 93.6% using isopropanol as the solvent and hydrogen source. Zirconia is proved to be located mainly out of the mesoporous channels for Zr-SBA-UH, which leads to significant enhancement in the acid content of the catalyst, and then greatly promotes the catalytic performance of Zr-SBA-UH for the reductive etherification of HMF. The general soundness of Zr-SBA-UH in other monohydric alcohols is further confirmed in this contribution, guaranteeing that a family of BAMFs can be prepared by this catalytic system. In addition, Zr-SBA-UH is a robust catalyst that can be reused for at least five continuous runs without a significant loss of its catalytic activity. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - Waste oils are becoming increasingly more important as feedstock for the production of fuels and glycerol as byproduct. Optimization of homogeneous transesterification of waste frying oil (WFO) to biodiesel over hydroxide potassium (KOH) catalyst have been investigated. In this respect, response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to determine the relationships between methanol and WFO molar ratio (3:1-12:1), KOH concentration (0.5%-2%) and temperature (25-65 °C) on the conversion yield. Transesterification of WFO produced 96.33% maximum methyl ester yield at the optimum methanol/WFO molar ratio 7.3:1, KOH loading 0.5 wt. % and the reaction temperature was 58.30 °C. The physicochemical properties of optimized biodiesel met the requirements of the European Norm 14214, such as kinematic viscosity at 40 °C 4.57 mm/s2, the sulfur content 0.005 wt. %, and the density at 15 °C 889.3 kg/m3. This study also examined the accelerated oxidation of biodiesel and biodiesel/diesel blends under combined temperature and air effect at different periods of time while measuring their acidity. Results have shown that total acid number increased proportionally to the biodiesel content of the biodiesel/diesel blends from 0.5 mgKOH/g for B7 (7% (v/v) biodiesel and 93% (v/v) diesel) up to 2.8 mg KOH/g for B100 (100% biodiesel). The synthesized trans-esterified oil can be a potential alternative to petrodiesel, hence its application at an industrial scale. This work also reports some properties of crude glycerol (CG) derived from biodiesel from WFO. The glycerol yield (%), pH, water content (wt. %), density at 15 °C (g/cm3), and kinematic viscosity at 40 °C (mm2/s) was analyzed according to standard test methods. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Promoting the deployment of forest-based drop-in and high blend biofuels is considered strategically important in Sweden but many aspects of the overall performance of the foremost production technologies are as yet unexamined. This paper evaluates the technology maturity, profitability, investment requirements, GHG performance and Swedish biofuel production potential of six commercially interesting forest-based biofuel production pathways. Significant heterogeneity in technology maturity was observed. Lack of technical demonstration in industrially representative scales renders the liquefaction-hydrotreatment route for drop-in biofuels less mature than its gasification-catalytic upgrading counterpart. It is a paradox that short-term priority being accorded to pathways with the lowest technology maturity. Nth-of-a-kind investments in (a) gasification-based methanol, (b) hydropyrolysis-based petrol/diesel, and (c) lignin depolymerization-based petrol/diesel were profitable for a range of plant sizes. The profitability of pulp mill-integrated small gasification units (<100 MW) goes against the common perception of gasification being economically feasible only in large scales. New low-cost options for debottlenecking production at recovery boiler-limited kraft mills appear worth investigating. GHG emission reductions ranged from 66 to 95%; a penalty was incurred for high consumption of natural gas-based hydrogen. Swedish biofuel production potentials ranged from 4 to 27 TWh/y but a more feasible upper limit is 12–15 TWh/y. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bio-oil upgrading through its hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) using sulfided catalysts has attracted significant attention because of its potential to provide advanced biofuels. Although many studies have been undertaken, a detailed understanding of the changes in the chemical composition on the molecular level that would allow the better design of catalysts for bio-oil upgrading is still insufficient. Therefore, we have subjected straw bio-oil and products obtained from its hydrotreatment over a broad range of experimental conditions to a detailed quantitative chemical analysis. Most of the volatile compounds were quantified by GC-MS. Among them, 115 compounds were quantified directly (i.e., using the appropriate standards) and more than 100 indirectly (i.e., based on their structural similarity with corresponding standards). Moreover, the total concentrations of carboxylic acids, carbonyls and phenols were quantified by the carboxylic acid number (CAN), Faix, and Folin-Ciocalteu methods, respectively, to obtain complementary and supporting information on the chemical composition to the GC-MS data. The detailed quantification of most volatile compounds in the feed and the products allowed us to create a reactivity order of the oxygen-containing functional groups present and to understand the origin of some of the compounds. On the basis of the results, the upgrading of straw bio-oil from ablative fast pyrolysis at 340 °C and 4 MPa seems to be optimal when evaluating the severity of the reaction conditions and hydrogen consumption, on the one hand, and the products quality, on the other hand. This provides a good starting point for further catalyst development and optimization allowing the long-term upgrading of the bio-oil for obtaining petroleum-refinery-compatible feedstock. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In the present study polystyrene waste (PS) was collected from a drop off site in a local market and pyrolyzed at heating rates of 5, 10, 15 and 20 °C/min and temperature range 40–600 °C under nitrogen condition. The apparent activation energy (Ea) and pre-exponential factor (A) were determined using 6 different kinetic methods. Activation energy and pre-exponential factor were found in the range of 82.3 – 202.8 kJmol −1 and 3.5 × 10 6 –7.6 × 10 14 min −1 respectively. The results demonstrated that the calculated values of Ea and A vary with fraction of conversion, heating rates and the applied model. Moreover, pyrolysis of waste polystyrene was carried out in an indigenously manufactured furnace at temperatures ranging from 340 to 420 °C. The composition of liquid and gaseous fractions was determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Temperature and reaction time were optimized and the results revealed that temperature of 410 °C and exposure time of 70 min are the best conditions for maximum fuel oil production. Methane and ethane were found as the main products in the gas phase constituting about 82% of the gaseous fraction. The liquid products composed of broad range of C 2 – C 15 hydrocarbons depending on the pyrolytic parameters. A comparison of the composition of pyrolysis oil with standard parameters of diesel, gasoline and kerosene oil suggested that pyrolysis oil from polystyrene waste holds great promise for replacing fuel oil. © 2019

AB  - Camelina [Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz] is a short-season annual oilseed crop in the Brassicaceae family. Interest in camelina has increased substantially during the past 15 years because the oil is an excellent feedstock for producing low-carbon-emission biofuel and has a unique fatty acid profile as a potential edible oil. Camelina has been promoted as an alternative crop in low-precipitation dryland regions because of its low fertilizer requirement and drought tolerance. An 8-yr field experiment was conducted from 2010 to 2017 at the WSU Dryland Research Station near Lind, WA to compare a 3-yr winter wheat (WW)-spring camelina-summer fallow (SF) rotation with the traditional 2-yr WW-SF rotation. Annual crop-year (Sept. 1-Aug. 31) precipitation ranged from 193 to 375 mm and averaged 281 mm. Camelina seed yield ranged from 339 to 1175 kg/ha and averaged 643 kg/ha. Mean WW yield of 2692 kg/ha in the 3-yr rotation was significantly lower (p = 0.046) compared to 2862 kg/ha in the 2-yr rotation. Soil profile water was significantly lower (p < 0.001) after harvest of camelina compared to after WW harvest in the 2-yr rotation. This soil water reduction was consistently measured throughout the ensuing 13-month fallow cycle. There are no labeled in-crop broadleaf weed herbicides for camelina and populations of Russian thistle (Salsola tragus L.) and tumble mustard (Sisymbrium altissimum L.) were higher in camelina than in WW. This was likely a factor in the deep extraction of soil water in the camelina plots to a depth of 180 cm. Data from this study suggest that, with current cultivars and management practices, camelina is not yet agronomically or economically stable or viable in a 3-yr WW-camelina-SF rotation in the low-precipitation (<300 mm annual) rainfed cropping region of the Inland Pacific Northwest (PNW). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The availability of natural energy resources and the environmental issues are the most significant issues that are often highlighted by the world communities. With regard to these problems, isobutanol is a higher chain alcohol with four carbons which can be derived from biomass resources and it is potential to become an alternative fuel source besides the biodiesel for a diesel engine. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of isobutanol with Calophyllum inophyllum methyl ester and diesel as the ternary blend on physicochemical properties, engine performance, and emission characteristics. Five different fuel blends containing Calophyllum inophyllum biodiesel and isobutanol were tested on a single-cylinder direct injection diesel engine at different engine load of brake mean effective pressure. The physicochemical properties of the fuel blends were measured and then compared with neat diesel. The results indicate that the blend containing isobutanol and CIME gives a slight increase in BSEC and EGT and a minimal drop in BTE as compared to that of neat diesel. Besides that, the tested blends show a reduction of carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbon emissions. Meanwhile, all the fuel blends show a minimal increase in carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions, compared to that of neat diesel. Isobutanol can be proved as a preferred substitute for biodiesel and diesel fuels to achieve desired engine performance and emissions level. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Large-scale microalgae cultivation for biodiesel production is expected to be performed utilizing open air growth infrastructure that will inherently introduce ash into the system. High ash biomass represents a significant challenge for the production of biofuel as it increases processing capital and operational costs. This study assesses the economic viability of pretreatment to remove ash from biomass grown with an algal turf scrubber (ATS). An engineering process model of biofuel production was developed based on an ATS growth system followed by an ash removal process and conversion of the biomass to fuels through hydrothermal liquefaction. The model was validated with literature data for the growth and conversion processes and with experimental data for 14 de-ashing processes using water washing or alkaline extraction. The engineering process model was integrated with techno-economic modeling to investigate the impact of ash on biomass and fuel selling prices. Capital costs associated with biofuel conversion doubled as ash content increased from 0% to 70%, increasing fuel selling price by 21%. Integrating ash removal resulted in reduced conversion capital costs (14–42%) based on the reduction of total mass processed. However, only water washes scenarios at 25 °C and 50 °C were found to reduce overall fuel selling price, with alkaline extraction scenarios showing a significant increase. Operational expenses associated with alkaline extraction de-ashing including wastewater treatment, chemical costs, and heating the microalgae slurry were found to significantly increase the overall fuel selling price of the microalgae biofuel by 17–92% depending on the operational scenario. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - TiO 2 -ZnO heterogeneous catalytic system provides a good replacement of a homogeneous catalytic reaction due to its easier recovery. In this study, biodiesel was produced from Ulva lactuca seaweeds using TiO 2 –ZnO nanocomposite catalysts with particle size of ~12 nm. The size controlled TiO 2 –ZnO nanocomposite was characterized by powder XRD analysis and TEM. The result of that TiO 2 –ZnO catalyst is a promising catalyst for the production of biodiesel under mild reaction conditions and high yield of hydroxydecanoic acid conversion of 82.8%. The various conditions optimized for the higher conversion to FAME (15.8 ml of FAME) were 4 wt% catalysts at 4 h under 60 °C and further there is no increase of conversion to FAME above 60 °C–80 °C. The total product yield was calculated as 82.8% of conversion to FAME. The evaluated biodiesel was found to be up to the mark of ASTM standards. The silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were synthesized by using leftover biomass of algae obtaining after lipid extraction of U.lactuca. AgNPs particle size was achieved as ~12 nm and was confirmed by UV–Visible spectroscopy, XRD and TEM analysis. Antibacterial activities of the synthesized AgNPs were analyzed and compared. The antibacterial activity was excellent against bacterial pathogens and treatment against P. vulgaris shows the maximum zone of inhibition (13.8 mm). The present work identified that the unutilized bioresource such as U.lactuca can be effectively utilized for biodiesel production so as to replace fossil fuel usage. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study aims to identify the potential for the deployment of diesel biofuel production based on forestry residues conversion through Fischer-Tropsch synthesis in Brazil. It develops a technical and economic analysis to estimate in what extension (georeferenced analysis) and at what costs (process analysis) can this biomass-based diesel contribute to the Brazilian diesel supply, and to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Findings indicate the annual techno-economic potential of 80.3 PJ (considering the use of eucalyptus and pine residues), mostly concentrated in the South, Midwest and Southeast regions of the country. Overall, 21 production hotspots were identified, allowing the deployment of 27 facilities across the country. A clear advantage of this fuel production route is the fact that the carbon capture and storage can be intrinsic to the process, leading to negative CO2 emissions of the fuel production chain. Total mitigation potential is nearly 25 MtCO2 yearly. Furthermore, while still not cost-competitive without ambitious climate and energy policies in place, the forestry residue-based diesel can contribute to the reduction of the country's dependency on imports, resulting in positive impacts on the Brazilian trade balance. © 2019

AB  - Various research works are being undertaken around the world on the subject of thermal efficiency improvisation and emission reduction from diesel engines. This research work analyzes the performance and emission characteristics of a thermal barrier coated diesel engine which used palm biodiesel. The piston and cylinder liners were coated with equal percentages of alumina (Al 2 O 3 ) and yittria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) powder using plasma spraying coating method. The piston was coated with 100 μm thickness and the two cylinder liners were coated with 150 and 200 μm thicknesses and were used to analyze the performance and emission characteristics. Test results of the thermal barrier coated engine using palm biodiesel were compared with the results derived from the base engine. The tests revealed an increase of 3.8% specific fuel consumption (SFC) as an average when neat palm biodiesel was used in the base engine. Interestingly, the palm biodiesel used in the 150- and 200-μm thick thermal barrier coated engine was responsible for a significant decrease of the SFC by an average of 4.18% and 8.05% respectively. The brake thermal efficiency was found to decrease on an average of 1.02% when tests were run using the neat palm biodiesel in the base engine. But an average proportionate increase of 0.72% and 2.19% was visible when palm biodiesel was used in the tests conducted on the 150- and 200-μm thick thermal barrier coated engine. There was also an understandable brake specific reduction of 0.991 g/kWh carbon monoxide (CO) emission and 0.025 g/kWh unburned hydrocarbon (HC) levels. The nitrogen oxide (NO x ) emission was observed as 14.06 g/kWh in the 200-μm thick thermal barrier coated engine which was slightly higher when the results were compared with that of the uncoated engine. The novelty of this research investigation is based on the usage of yttrium-stabilized zirconia and alumina thermal barrier coating on the cylinder liner and piston head of engine. This is justified due to the fact that most of the previous investigations undertaken focused on the thermal barrier coating in the piston, valve, and cylinder head alone. The utility factor of the palm biodiesel (B 100) in the low heat rejection engine has also proved to be another significant and novel factor in the present investigation outlined in this paper. This is mainly due to the fact that the ongoing investigations in this realm concentrated only on blends of 20 to 30% of palm biodiesel with diesel fuel in the low heat rejection diesel engine. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study evaluates the potential for making advanced biofuels from genetically modified (GM) lipid–producing sorghum. A biodiesel coproduction process is developed to extract, purify, and upgrade lipids to diesel fuel while carbohydrates are utilized for making ethanol through acid thermal pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, and fermentation. To assess the advantages of coproducing biodiesel from GM–sorghum, process economics are compared to a cellulosic ethanol biorefinery receiving non-GM sorghum. Minimum ethanol selling prices (MESP) that reach a breakeven point after 30 years of service life are calculated as an economic index to compare the two processes. Results indicate that biodiesel coproduction improves the economics by lowering the MESP from $3.08/gal for the ethanol-only process to $2.46/gal. Sensitivity analyses reveal that increasing sorghum's lipid content, increasing the lipid extraction efficiency, and reducing the solvent-to-solids ratio in lipid extraction columns are the most important process parameters to further enhance technoeconomics. Analyses indicate that a lipid content above 13 wt% (dry basis) or a biomass price less than $65/Mg (dry basis) will result in a 2014 ethanol wholesale price of $2.25/gal for the coproduction process. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microbial-derived biodiesel was tested on a lab scale CI diesel engine for carrying out exhaust emission and performance characteristics. The performance, emission, and combustion characteristics of a single cylinder four stroke fixed compression ratio engine when fueled with microbial bio-diesel and its 10–30% blends with diesel (on a volume basis) were investigated and compared with conventional diesel. The bio-diesel was obtained from microbes which were grown by combining distillery spent wash with lignocellulosic hydrolysate at nutrient deprived conditions. The microbes consumed the wastes and converted the high strength waste water into lipids, which were trans-esterified to form bio-diesel. Testing of microbial bio-diesel blends with ordinary diesel at different loading pressures and the emission characteristics were compared. Results indicate that with increasing of the blends, reduction of HC and CO emissions were observed, whilst brake thermal efficiency maxed out at 20% blending. Further increase of blends showed a tendency of increasing of both emissions in the exhaust stream. The Brake Specific Fuel consumption was observed to decline with blending until 20% and then increased. The nitrogen oxide emissions, however, were found to increase with increasing blend ratios and reached a maximum at 20% blend. The escalation of HC, CO, CO 2 , and NOx emissions was also observed at higher blending ratios and higher engine loads. The performance studies were able to show that out of the three blends of biodiesel, 20% biodiesel blend was able to deliver the best of reduced hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions, whilst also delivering the highest Brake thermal efficiency and the lowest Brake Specific Fuel consumption. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The present work is aimed to analyze the performance and emission characteristics of mahua biodiesel-fueled diesel engine with copper oxide nanoparticle at various particle sizes (10 and 20 nm) and the results compared with conventional diesel fuel (BD). Experiments were conducted in a four-stroke, single-cylinder, constant speed, and naturally aspirated research diesel engine with an eddy current dynamometer. Conventional transesterification process is carried out to convert the raw mahua oil into mahua oil biodiesel (BD100). Copper oxide (CuO) was chosen as a nanoparticle; the mass fraction of 100 ppm and the particle sizes of 10 and 20 nm were blended with mahua oil methyl ester using an ultrasonicator, and the physicochemical properties were measured. The physicochemical properties of BD100 and nanoparticle-included BD100 are at par with EN14214 limits. Brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) of BD100 is higher than that of diesel, and brake thermal efficiency (BTE) is lower than that of diesel (D100). The inclusion of 10-nm particle size of CuO nanoparticle in BD100 improves the BSFC and BTE by 1.3 and 0.7%, respectively, when compared with BD100. The CuO nanoparticle inclusion at 20-nm nanoparticle in biodiesel further improves the performance parameters than those at 10-nm nanoparticle. Further, the BD100 promotes a lower level of smoke emissions, carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrocarbon (HC) and with a prominent increase in oxides of nitrogen (NO x ) emissions. The inclusion of 10-nm particle size of CuO nanoparticle in BD100 reduces the NO x , HC, CO, and smoke emission by 3.9, 5.6, 4.9, and 2.8%, respectively, at peak load condition when compared with BD100. The addition of CuO nanoparticle at 20-nm nanoparticle in biodiesel further reduces the NO x , HC, CO, and smoke emissions. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This work firstly explores the feasibility of using a novel microwave-assisted, catalysed, hydrothermal process for the valorisation of brewers’ spent grains (BSGs), examining the effects of the temperature (180–250 °C), pressure (50–130 bar), reaction time (0–2 h) and catalyst amount (Ni-Co/Al-Mg, 0–0.25 g cat/g biomass). This route turned out to be a very promising approach for the production of bio-fuels (bio-oil and bio-char) and platform chemicals (sugar rich aqueous solutions) in a single unit, helping the development of an innovative bio-refinery around BSGs. The overall conversion and the yields to gas, aqueous fraction and bio-oil varied by 31–68%, 10–33%, 9–48% and 4–14%, respectively. The bio-oil was made up a complex mixture of phenols (0–26%), ketones (0–80%), aldehydes (0–57%), carboxylic acids (0–18%) and nitrogen compounds (0–76%). The proportions of C, H, N and O in the bio-oil varied as follow: 15–61 wt%, 5–10 wt%, 1–6 wt% and 26–77 wt%, respectively, which shifted its higher heating value (HHV) between 9 and 27 MJ/kg. The liquid fraction comprised a mixture of DP > 6 oligosaccharides (67–98 C-wt.%), DP2-6 oligosaccharides (0–10 C-wt.%), saccharides (0.2–7 C-wt.%), carboxylic acids (0–7 C-wt.%) and furans (0–27 C-wt.%). The spent solid after the experiments resembled an energetic like bio-char product, whose proportions of C, H, O and N varied by 35–72 wt%, 4–8 wt%, 1–4 wt% and 18–57 wt% and its HHV shifted between 9 and 32 MJ/kg. The optimisation of the process revealed that using a temperature of 250 °C and a pressure of 125 bar for 2 h, it is possible to convert the original material into high-energy biofuels: (8%) bio-oil (26 MJ/kg) and (35%) bio-char (32 MJ/kg); together with a (31%) saccharide-rich (>99 C-wt.%) aqueous solution, thus converting this process into a very promising approach to achieve an environmentally-friendly and integral valorisation of brewers’ spent grains. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Research into trees plays a very important role in evaluations of soil contamination with diesel oil. Trees are ideal for reclaiming contaminated soils because their large biomass renders them more resistant to higher concentrations of pollutants. In the literature, there is a general scarcity of long-term studies performed on trees, in particular European beeches. The aim of this study was to evaluate the responses of Scots pines and European beeches grown for 8 years on soil contaminated with diesel oil. Selected morphological and physiological parameters of trees were analyzed. The biomass yield of Scots pines was not significantly correlated with increasing concentrations of diesel oil, but it was more than 700% higher than in European beeches. Scots pines were taller and had a larger stem diameter than European beeches during the 8-year study. The diameter of trees grown on the most contaminated soil was reduced 1.5-fold in Scots pines and more than twofold in European beeches. The length of Scots pine needles from the most contaminated treatment decreased by 50% relative to control needles. The shortest needles were heaviest. The fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of needle length was highest in Scots pines grown on the most contaminated soil, whereas the reverse was noted in the FA of needle weight. Diesel oil decreased the concentrations of chlorophylls a and b, total chlorophyll, and carotenoids. The Fv/Fm ratio of needles and leaves was influenced by the tested concentrations of diesel oil. The results of the study indicate that the Scots pine better adapts (grows more rapidly and produces higher biomass) to long-term soil contamination with diesel oil than the European beech. In European beeches, growth inhibition and leaf discoloration (a decrease in chlorophyll content) were observed already after the first year of the experiment, which indicates that 1-year-old seedlings of European beech are robust bioindicators of soil contamination with diesel oil. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - A green and efficient solid acid catalyst was developed for direct conversion of Jatropha oil into biodiesel over Ni modified phosphomolybdic acid (HPMo)/carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in a fixed-bed reactor. Under optimal conditions (Temperature = 330 °C, Pressure = 3 MPa, H2/oil (v/v) = 800 N m3 m−3, Liquid hourly space velocity = 1 h−1), the yield of biodiesel (C15-C18 alkanes) was 86.7 wt%, and the conversion was 98.2%. The conversion was 86.1% during five runs of recycling. Comparing with the thermal cracking process, the catalytic cracking exhibited the same performance at a lower temperature. A possible reaction pathway to the reaction was suggested. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Pt/C has a good performance for decarboxylation of oleic acid, but its catalytic stability needs further improvement. In this work, metal oxide films with controllable thicknesses were synthesized using atomic layer deposition to protect the Pt in the Pt/C to increase its catalytic stability. Compared to Pt/C, which showed only a 17% yield of heptadecane at the fourth catalytic cycle, the Pt/C deposited with porous Al2O3 films after high-temperature calcination showed improved catalytic stability that still obtained a 41% yield of heptadecane at the fourth catalytic cycle. These findings are important for improving the stability of noble metal–based catalysts and reducing the cost of industrial biofuel production. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The platform chemicals 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD) and 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BD) are important raw materials for polyesters and biofuels. However, the biosynthesis of the compounds relies on massive consumption of glucose or glycerol, leading to the uneconomical production in industrial scale. In this work, we developed a new method for co-production of 1,3-PD and 2,3-BD from waste lard to reduce the cost in carbon source supply. A waste lard utilizing Pseudomonas alcaligenes PA-3 and a 1,3-PD producing Klebsiella pneumoniae AA405 were co-cultivated by using waste lard as the sole carbon source. In a shake flask, 1.05 g/L 1,3-PD and 0.35 g/L 2,3-BD were produced from waste lard within 24 h. The addition of nitrogen source significantly increased the relative ratio of K. pneumoniae AA405 in the medium, which further favored to the higher titers of the two products. In bioreactor, the co-cultivation system produced 5.98 g/L 1,3-PD and 4.29 g/L 2,3-BD from 100 g/L waste lard within 72 h, and the conversion rate of 1,3-PD and 2,3-BD from waste lard were 62.95% and 0.75%, respectively. In all, this is the first work on 1,3-PD and 2,3-BD production from waste triglyceride, which will favor the utilization of low-cost carbon source in industrial production of chemicals. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Biorefineries can be a good alternative to cover the current needs of energy, such as transportation fuels and also fine chemicals. 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) can be obtained directly from biomass, and it is considered one of the most promising intermediate for the synthesis of biofuels. In this work the production of 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) and 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran (DMTHF), two particularly attractive compounds to be used as biofuels due to its similar characteristics to gasoline, has been studied. For this purpose, a continuous fixed bed catalytic reactor was employed using HMF as raw material. Zr-supported Cu, Ce–Cu, Ru–Cu and Ni–Cu catalysts were tested. Moreover, the catalysts textural properties were also measured - before and after the activity tesst - in order to get a deeper understanding of the relationships among the measured DMF yields and the catalyst characteristics. Final DMF, DMTHF and butanol separation was also evaluated. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Aircraft soot has a significant impact on global and local air pollution and is of particular concern for the population working at airports and living nearby. The morphology and chemistry of soot are related to its reactivity and depend mainly on engine operating conditions and fuel-type. We investigated the morphology (by transmission electron microscopy) and chemistry (by X-ray micro-spectroscopy) of soot from the exhaust of a CFM 56-7B26 turbofan engine, currently the most common engine in aviation fleet, operated in the test cell of SR Technics, Zurich airport. Standard kerosene (Jet A-1) and a biofuel blend (Jet A-1 with 32% HEFA) were used at ground idle and climb-out engine thrust, as these conditions highly influence air quality at airport areas. The results indicate that soot reactivity decreases from ground idle to climb-out conditions for both fuel types. Nearly one third of the primary soot particles generated by the blended fuel at climb-out engine thrust bear an outer amorphous shell implying higher reactivity. This characteristic referring to soot reactivity needs to be taken into account when evaluating the advantage of HEFA blending at high engine thrust. The soot type that is most prone to react with its surrounding is generated by Jet A-1 fuel at ground idle. Biofuel blending slightly lowers soot reactivity at ground idle but does the opposite at climb-out conditions. As far as soot reactivity is concerned, biofuels can prove beneficial for airports where ground idle is a common situation; the benefit of biofuels for climb-out conditions is uncertain. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The utilisation of gaseous hydrogen (H2) in compression ignition (CI) engines is a viable option for simultaneously solving the problems of energy efficiency improvements and emissions reduction, including greenhouse gases because combustion does not produce CO2. This paper is the second of three of a study devoted to the analysis of dual combustion (diesel-H2) in internal combustion engines. In this Part II, a diesel engine is modified to run using a hydrogen-diesel mixture as a dual fuel. This mode of operation has been studied for two speeds and different diesel injection strategies, up to a H2/diesel mass ratio of 1. In order to control NOx emissions, intake self-ignition and combustion knocking, water was injected into the intake manifold. The test results show that smoke emissions decrease and NOx emissions increase with an increase in the H2/diesel ratio, but water injection produces a reduction in the NOx emissions of around 50%, with an almost flat efficiency of 37%. This article contains a study of the parametrization of the heat release rate (HRR) to obtain a functional law that allows us to reproduce the HRR through several initial parameters for the cases studied in Parts I (H2 as main fuel) and II. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This article presents the results of investigations carried out to evaluate the improvement in combustion, performance, and emission characteristics of a diesel engine fueled with neat petro-diesel (PD), soybean biodiesel (SB), and 50% SB blended PD (PD50SB) by using carbon nanotube (CNT) as an additive. The acid–alkaline-based transesterification process with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) as a catalyst was applied to derive the methyl ester of SB. A mass fraction of 100 ppm CNT nanoparticle was blended with base fuels by using an ultrasonicator and the physiochemical properties were measured based on EN standards. The measured physiochemical properties are in good agreement with standard limits. The experimental evaluations were carried out under varying brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) conditions in a single-cylinder, four-stroke, and natural aspirated research diesel engine at a constant speed of 1500 rpm. The results reveal that the SB and its blend promote shorter ignition delay period (IDP) that is resulting in lower in-cylinder pressure (ICP) and net heat release rate (NHR) compared to PD. The SB and its blend increase the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), and reduce the brake specific energy consumption (BSEC) and exhaust gas temperature (EGT), due to lower heating value, and efficient combustion, respectively. As far as the emission characteristics are concerned, the SB and its blend promote lower magnitude of hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), and smoke emissions compared to PD except for oxides of nitrogen (NO x ) emission. The CNT nanoparticle inclusion with base fuels significantly improves the combustion, performance, and emissions level irrespective of engine load conditions. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Coke formation is one major problem during thermal conversion of bio-oil and its main components. Fundamental knowledge about the evolution of the structure of cokes is a prerequisite towards a deep understanding of coking of bio-oil. This study investigates the structure (morphology, elemental composition, O-containing functional groups and aromatic structures) of cokes generated from the pyrolysis of aromatic-rich fraction (ARF) and the aromatic-poor fraction (APF) of bio-oil. The effects of interactions of ARF and APF on properties of the coke formed during the pyrolysis of bio-oil are also studied. The results show that the cokes from the pyrolysis of APF (APF-cokes) are sponge-like while the cokes from the pyrolysis of ARF (ARF-cokes) have a dense structure. The matrix of cokes from the pyrolysis of the whole bio-oil (oil-cokes) is similar to the matrix of ARF-cokes, while its surface is similar to that of APF-cokes, which should be due to the interactions between different bio-oil fractions. The APF-cokes contain more C–O, O–H and C[dbnd]O functional groups than the ARF-cokes due to the higher O content of APF. Moreover, the interactions between ARF and APF can promote more O-containing species to be transformed as C–O, O–H and C[dbnd]O functional groups in the oil-cokes. The aromatic rings of ARF-cokes and APF-cokes can be cracked to form smaller ring systems at 300–500 °C, while it is opposite for the oil-cokes because the aromatic structures formed via the interactions between ARF and APF are more stable. At higher temperatures (>500 °C), the interactions (e.g. self-gasification) lead to the highly condensed cokes, while the secondary cokes, which are spherical particles, are preferentially consumed by the steam. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Gaseous fuel as a combustion enhancer with a pilot fuel offers significant benefits in improving engine efficiency. Hydrogen and hydroxy are the two most common gaseous fuels that have been widely investigated in the CI engine but which one performs best is still inconvenient. In this study, hydrogen and hydroxy were injected with BD40 (v/v) separately in a common diesel engine to compare the performance and emission characteristics of these fuels. Engine performance parameters include brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and brake-specific energy consumption (BSEC), and exhaust emissions include hydrocarbon (HC), CO, CO 2 , NOx, and smoke opacity. The induction of both hydroxy and hydrogen with BD40 has a positive effect on engine performance and emissions except NOx when compared to neat diesel fuel and BD40. The BTE of hydroxy-rich BD40 increased by 7.2% while BSEC reduced by 7.6% as compared to BD40 with hydrogen. The CO, HC, and smoke opacity of hydroxy-operated engine was found to be better than hydrogen-inducted engine. The NOx emission increased with the induction of both gaseous fuels and hydroxy-enriched BD40 produced 12.5% more emission than hydrogen-operated BD40 engine. Thus, more concisely, hydroxy-operated biodiesel engine performed better than hydrogen engine in terms of BTE, BSEC, CO, HC, and smoke opacity. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate a life cycle assessment of straight vegetable oil (SVO) and biodiesel addressing alternative upstream pathways. The pathways are SVO and biodiesel produced in the United Kingdom (UK) using European rapeseed and also, SVO and biodiesel produced in the UK using soybean grain and soybean oil imported from Argentina. Four environmental impact categories have been assessed using the SimaPro (ReCiPe life-cycle impact assessment) method: this includes global warming potential (GWP); acidification; eutrophication and particulate matter. Rapeseed based biofuel had the lowest emission impact in terms of GHG emissions. Significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can result from land use change due to the expansion and cultivation of soybean in Argentina. When land use change is not considered, the soy based biofuel system has the lowest GHG impact with more than 70% GHG emission reduction. The GHG emission at cultivation stage far outweighs the impacts of the other life-cycle stages irrespective of the feedstock used for the biofuel production systems. The use of fertilizers and associated soil emissions are the main contributors. The environmental impacts of biofuel can be reduced by avoiding land use change, improving soil management practices and yield, and also optimizing transportation routes. Effective implementation of options for biofuels production were explored to improve sustainability in shipping. © 2019

AB  - The Green Growth Framework for Fiji under its theme for sustainable maritime transportation, envisages deployment of renewable energy technologies, retrofitting of existing vessels and development of improved vessel designs as some of the measures needed to make shipping more energy efficient. In this study, the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System (LEAP) tool is used to develop various maritime transport scenarios (2016–2040) based on possible interventions. Domestic maritime transport used approximately 79 million litres of fuel in 2016 out of which 77% was marine diesel oil while the remaining was premix. The total emissions from maritime transport in 2016 was estimated to be 214 Gg of CO 2 e. At 2% annual growth rate in maritime passenger and freight activity, the total annual fuel consumption will increase to 127 million litres by 2040 with corresponding GHG emissions of 342 Gg of CO 2 e under the BAU scenario. This paper quantifies possible reductions in fossil fuel usage and associated emissions through energy efficiency and alternative fuels in the domestic sea transport sector in Fiji. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - According to that the fuel pump and injectors of the diesel engines are lubricated by the fuel itself, so the lubrication property of the fuels is an important issue in internal combustion engines. Biodiesel is one of the most famous biofuels that can be used in diesel engines. In this research, wear characteristics of biodiesel derived from sunflower and soybean oil blends were investigated. The five fuel blends were tested under steady-state conditions (with durations of 1500 and 3600 s) at four different rotational speeds of 600, 900, 1200, and 1500 rpm. An optical microscope was also applied to check out the worn surfaces of the balls. The results indicated that wear and friction as tribological properties were reduced with the increase in the rotating speed under the steady-state condition. It was found that with an increase in the biodiesel concentration, the friction coefficient was reduced at lower rotating speeds due to free fatty acids, monoglycerides, and diglycerides as the components of biodiesel which help improve the lubrication properties of biodiesel and reduce the friction more than that of other blends. However, in higher rotational speeds, friction and wear of fuel blends included biodiesel increased due to reduced viscosity as the causes of oxidation which helps in the exposure of biodiesel to air at higher temperature. So, B100 has better lubricity properties compared to other fuel blends at lower rotational speeds, and better performance belongs to B20 at higher rotational speeds. Copyright © 2019 by ASME.

AB  - In order to obtain the N-containing organics from cellulose under mild conditions, hydrothermal liquefaction of cellulose in the presence of ammonia was conducted in this study. The results showed that the increasing reaction temperature and prolonging time facilitated the conversion of cellulose in hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) with NH3·H2O and decreased the amount of solid residue. Reaction temperature showed more influence than reaction time on solid residue formation. The components of bio-oil were significantly affected by reaction temperature and reaction time. Electrospray ionization-Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry (ESI FT-ICR MS) provided an insight for understanding the distribution of the different kinds of N-heterocycle compounds in the bio-oil. The possible reaction pathway of N-heterocycle compounds formation from cellulose during hydrothermal liquefaction with NH3·H2O was proposed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Increased use of 1st and 2nd generation biofuels raises concerns about health effects of new emissions. We analyzed cellular and molecular lung effects in Fisher 344 rats exposed to diesel engine exhaust emissions (DEE) from a Euro 5-classified diesel engine running on B7: petrodiesel fuel containing 7% fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), or SHB20 (synthetic hydrocarbon biofuel): petrodiesel fuel containing 7% FAME and 13% hydrogenated vegetable oil. The Fisher 344 rats were exposed for 7 consecutive days (6 h/day) or 28 days (6 h/day, 5 days/week), both with and without diesel particle filter (DPF) treatment of the exhaust in whole body exposure chambers (n = 7/treatment). Histological analysis and analysis of cytokines and immune cell numbers in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) did not reveal adverse pulmonary effects after exposure to DEE from B7 or SHB20 fuel. Significantly different gene expression levels for B7 compared to SHB20 indicate disturbed redox signaling (Cat, Hmox1), beta-adrenergic signaling (Adrb2) and xenobiotic metabolism (Cyp1a1). Exhaust filtration induced higher expression of redox genes (Cat, Gpx2) and the chemokine gene Cxcl7 compared to non-filtered exhaust. Exposure time (7 versus 28 days) also resulted in different patterns of lung gene expression. No genotoxic effects in the lungs were observed. Overall, exposure to B7 or SHB20 emissions suggests only minor effects in the lungs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this work, ubiquitous and blended learning focused on biofuel characterization, through three virtual laboratories, named “Determination of biodiesel heating value by automatic calorimeter” “Determination of biodiesel density by densimeter” and “Determination of biodiesel kinematic viscosity by Canon-Fenske viscometer” all integrated in a virtual platform, has been proposed. The idea was to approach environmental issues and sustainability needs to engineering students through biomass valorization or biorefinery development, avoiding or supporting costly lab equipment. Besides, same platform contents have been developed as web application and included in a Facebook social network group, named “BiomasaGen” which can be directly, automatically and ubiquitously accessed. Finally, verification, validation and evaluation of results from the developed three virtual laboratories and web app based on social network have been carried out, assisted by Context, Input, Process and Products method. The idea was to evaluate the inclusion of social networks, comparing the effectiveness of combining social networks and virtual laboratories as a new teaching methodology. As a result of this study, it was found that students appreciated both, developed virtual labs and network web app. Their decision was based on the accessibility of information, feedback during process, useful virtual training experiments and video tutorials, as well as theoretical concepts explained during virtual learning process. Social networks are used for almost all students; for this reason, they represent a powerful tool to improve communication between teachers and students, in this virtual learning context. The social network-based web app helped students to easily access virtual laboratories from any location, which was also very useful when University servers were not accessible or unavailable. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that ubiquitous and blended learning combined with experimental laboratory increases the probability of successful scores in final exams of Master subject (p-value 0.0183). Finally, students prefer social networks as a channel for exchanging information rather than common channels, i.e. e-mails. It may be concluded that the proposed combination of methodologies may significantly promote integration of subjects related to new sources of bioenergy (biodiesel and biorefineries) in postgraduate education. This methodology strongly approaches environmental and sustainability issues to education institutions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Castor is an important oil crop for bioenergy production and other valuable applications. NIAB Gold is first mutant variety of Pakistan developed by using gamma radiation. In this study, the oil was extracted from this new castor variety and was used for biodiesel production and as bio-pesticide. Due to high viscosity of castor oil, it was first refined with hot water degumming process. The degummed oil was used for biodiesel production in which important process parameters have been optimized. Maximum biodiesel yield (85%) was obtained by using 5:1 methanol to oil ratio, 3% catalyst dose, 70 ᵒC reaction temperature and 400 rpm stirring speed. The synthesized biodiesel was characterized by determining its important physico-chemical properties including specific gravity, viscosity, calorific value, acid value, iodine value, cetane number etc. Extracted castor oil was also tested as bio-pesticide against two insect species; Tribolium castaneum and Trogoderma granarium. By using 15% castor oil concentration and 72 h of exposure time, maximum larvicidal effect recorded against Tribolium castaneum was 32.17% and for Trogoderma granarium, it was found to be and 23.85%. LC50 values for Tribolium castaneum were also determined at different exposure times. The study results indicated that the NIAB Gold castor oil biodiesel meets the ASTM standards and NIAB Gold castor oil has good potential as bio-pesticide to control harmful insect pests. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The widespread use of diesel as a transportation fuel and the introduction of biodiesel into the world energy matrix increase the likelihood of aquatic contamination with these fuels. In this case, it is important to know the environmental impacts caused by water-soluble fraction (WSF) of these fuels, since it is the portion that can result in long-term impacts and affect regions far away from the location of a spill. Therefore, we evaluated and compared the aquatic ecotoxicity of the WSF of biodiesel and diesel through acute ecotoxicity tests with the aquatic microcrustacean Daphnia magna and the marine bacteria Aliivibrio fischeri, as well as chronic ecotoxicity tests with D. magna. The WSF of diesel was 2.5–4 folds more toxic than the WSF of biodiesel in acute ecotoxicity tests. Similarly, a comparison of the chronic ecotoxicity demonstrated that the WSF of diesel was more toxic than the WSF of biodiesel. WSF of diesel causes chronic effects on reproduction, longevity and growth of D. magna (NOEC was 12.5, 12.5, 6.25%, respectively), while WSF of biodiesel did not present significantly different results compared to the control for any of the parameters evaluated in any of the dilutions tested (NOEC> 25%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that compares the chronic ecotoxicity of WSF of diesel and biodiesel on D. magna. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The main objective of the study is to explore the potential of raw biogas as an alternative and standalone fuel for gasoline fueled spark ignition (SI) engine. In the current investigation, a single cylinder, spark ignition engine is operated both with gasoline and raw biogas at a compression ratio of 10 under wide open and part throttle conditions. The baseline test is performed with gasoline and subsequent experiments are carried out with raw biogas. The engine performance, combustion and emission parameters are measured over a range of speed variations (1450–1700 rpm). Comparative analysis of the result showed 18% of reduction in brake power, 66% of increase in brake specific fuel consumption and 12% of reduction in break thermal efficiency when the engine is fueled with raw biogas. Because of the non-uniformity in the amount of supplied air and fuel to the engine in every cycle, the coefficient of variation of indicative mean effective pressure and peak pressure (COVpp and COVIMEP) are seen to be higher for biogas. The emission components such as CO and NOx are significantly reduced by 40% and 81.5%, respectively, while, the unburnt hydrocarbon (UHC) and CO2 emission were increased by 6.8% and 40%, respectively. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biofuel production is seen in many countries around the world as an alternative fuel with less carbon footprint and GHG emission compared to the fossil fuels. Biofuel methyl ester is produced using transesterification process, a blend of triglycerides and alcohol that is made for running automotive engine. As the demand on biodiesel increased, more research studies needs to be done on the current diesel engine for replacing the diesel fuel by the biodiesel. Engine performance, emission, roughness are the major concerns for the automotive industry. An experimental combustion test was conducted on a Ricardo E6 single cylinder variable compression indirect injection engine, for three different liquid biofuels compared to baseline diesel fuel. The biofuels are Jojoba Methyl Ester (JME), Algae Methyl Ester (AME), and Chocolate Waste Methyl Ester (CME). Two main sets of experiments were conducted; in the first experiment, the engine load was varied from 0.5 to 15 Nm at a fixed speed, injection timing and compression ratio, while in the second fuel injection timing is varied from 20° before top dead center (BTDC) to 45° BTDC, at constant speed, load and compression ratio. The emission levels of CO, CO2, NOx, SOx and unburned hydrocarbons were measured, and the engine roughness, measured in (dP/dθ)max. JME showed an increase in pollution levels while AME decreased significantly the pollution levels. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition (RCCI) combustion has been established by modification of intake of a diesel engine. Studies were carried out on the existing engine with Conventional Diesel Combustion (CDC) and performance and emission parameters were recorded. Cotton seed biodiesel (COME) as low reactive fuel was injected into inlet manifold through a port fuel injector and diesel as high reactive fuel is injected in the cylinder through direct injection. Modified engine was tested for performance and emission characteristics. Simultaneous reduction in NOx and smoke emissions were observed with introduction of COME. CO2 emissions decreased marginally and unburnt hydrocarbons (UHC) decreased at lower percentages of COME and increased with higher percentages of COME. An increase in the Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTE) of the engine is observed at all loads. Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) and Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC) are lower in RCCI mode as compared to CDC. The optimum operating range of COME is observed with 10–20% of COME, which has 22% of average decrease in NOx and 30% decrease in the smoke emissions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper was to study whether un-preheated blends of palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) with commercial high speed diesel (CHSD) without adding any solvent to improve cold flow property could be used as a diesel substitute. In this work, PFAD-CHSD blends, 0–100 wt.% with 10 wt.% interval, were prepared by simple splash blending; their long-term phase behaviors at room temperature were observed; and, for the blends of interest, their important fuel properties were tested and their comparative use in a single cylinder diesel engine without preheating was evaluated at 2200 rpm with loads of 1.28–5.09 kW. Although PFAD had poor cold flow property, long-term stable liquid blends of PFAD ≤10 wt.% could be prepared. According to Thai standards, almost properties of these blends were suitable to use as a diesel substitute except acid values but their copper strip corrosions were similar to that of CHSD, No. 1a. The 5 and 10 wt.% PFAD blends were able to operate the tested engine in the same manner as CHSD with comparable performance, significantly lower smoke, slightly lower carbon monoxide, and significantly higher nitrogen oxides. In conclusion, the blends (PFAD ≤10 wt.%) are recommended to use as a simple cost-effective diesel substitute. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study aims to explore the effect of fuel ionisation on engine performance, emission and combustion characteristics of a twin cylinder compression ignition (CI) engine running on biofuel. Wheat germ oil (WGO) and pine oil (PO) have been identified as diesel fuel surrogates with high and low viscosities, respectively. High viscosity biofuels result in incomplete combustion due to poor atomisation and evaporation which ultimately leads to insufficient air-fuel mixing to form a combustible mixture. Consequently, engines running on this type of fuel suffer from lower brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and higher soot emission. In contrast, low viscosity biofuels exhibit superior combustion characteristics however they have a low cetane number which causes longer ignition delay and therefore higher NO emission. To overcome the limitations of both fuels, a fuel ionisation filter (FIF) with a permanent magnet is installed upstream of the fuel pump which electrochemically ionises the fuel molecules and aids in quick dispersion of the ions. The engine used in this investigation is a twin cylinder tractor engine that runs at a constant speed of 1500 rpm. The engine was initially run on diesel to warm-up before switching to WGO and PO, this was mainly due to poor cold start performance characteristics of both fuels. At 100% load, BTE for WGO is reduced by 4% compared to diesel and improved by 7% with FIF. In contrast, BTE for PO is 4% higher compared to diesel, however, FIF has minimal effect on BTE when running on PO. Although, smoke, HC and CO emissions were higher for WGO compared to diesel, they were lower with FIF due to improved combustion. These emissions were consistently lower for PO due to superior combustion performance, mainly attributed to low viscosity of the fuel. However, NO emission for PO (1610 ppm) is higher compared to diesel (1580 ppm) at 100% load and reduced with FIF (1415 ppm). NO emission is reduced by approximately 12% for PO + FIF compared to PO. The results suggest that FIF has the potential to improve diesel combustion performance and reduce NO emission produced by CI engines running on high and low viscosity biofuels, respectively. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel or renewable diesel fuels are alternative fuels produced from vegetable oil and animal tallow that are being considered to help reduce the use of petroleum-based fuels and emissions of air pollutants including greenhouse gases. Here, we analyzed the gene expression of inflammatory marker responses and the cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) enzyme after exposure to diesel and biodiesel emission samples generated from an in-use heavy-duty diesel vehicle. Particulate emission samples from petroleum-based California Air Resource Board (CARB)-certified ultralow sulfur diesel (CARB ULSD), biodiesel, and renewable hydro-treated diesel all induced inflammatory markers such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX)-2 and interleukin (IL)-8 in human U937-derived macrophages and the expression of the xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme CYP1A1. Furthermore, the results indicate that the particle emissions from CARB ULSD and the alternative diesel fuel blends activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and induce CYP1A1 in a dose- and AhR-dependent manner which was supported by the AhR luciferase reporter assay and gel shift analysis. Based on a per mile emissions with the model year 2000 heavy duty vehicle tested, the effects of the alternative diesel fuel blends emissions on the expression on inflammatory markers like IL-8 and COX-2 tend to be lower than emission samples derived from CARB ULSD fuel. The results will help to assess the potential benefits and toxicity from biofuel use as alternative fuels in modern technology diesel engines. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper proposed a novel method for the production of biodiesel from soy sauce residue under supercritical carbon dioxide for the first time. The effect of several parameters, such as the size of raw material, reaction pressure, temperature, time, and methanol/oil molar ratio were carefully optimized by single-factor experiments. The results showed that the optimized parameters were particle size 60 meshes, reaction pressure 16 MPa, temperature 100 °C, time 180min and methanol/oil molar ratio 35:1. Under this optimal conditions, biodiesel yield is as high as 96.21%. Furthermore, in order to better understand the advantages of this process, the mechanism and result of this process were compared with existing technology. The findings of this paper demonstrated that the soy sauce residue which was commonly considered as a waste can be efficiently converted to biodiesel by this method. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In engine tests where the feasibility of alternative fuels is being investigated, the results of the engine performance, combustion characteristics, and exhaust emissions should be considered as a whole. It is difficult to determine the optimal parameters due to a large number of results obtained in multi-variable experiments. Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods are preferred in solving such problems to energy management and energy efficiency. This paper deals with an application of a novel hybrid MCDM technique is suggested to select the optimum fuel for the compression ignition (CI). Five academicians who are an expert in the field of CI engines are selected to set criteria in the MCDM. Engine tests carried out at the constant engine speed and the resistive load of 10.8 kW in the generator-engine set. The results were used in the MCDM process. In this study, the hybrid models which are SWARA-MOORA, and ANP-MOORA has been preferred as the MCDM methods. The best fuel choice was made from fuels such as animal fat biodiesel (AFB), vegetable oil biodiesel (VOB), diesel fuel and the blend fuels. According to results, it was determined that the best fuel is VOB20 in both hybrid methods according to the determined criteria. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A single flow helical coil reactor (SFHR) and reverse flow helical coil reactor (RFHR) were designed for continuous biodiesel synthesis from a mixture of oils using KOH. BBD (Box-Behnken design) coupled with RSM (Response Surface Methodology) was carried out to optimize reaction variables for the transesterification reaction in the continuous reactor. The R2 value for SFHR and RFHR were 0.97 and 0.98 respectively which indicate the accuracy of the model. The results indicated that RFHR gives highest biodiesel yield than SFHR. Residence time due to reverse flow mixing shows a positive effect on biodiesel yield. The optimum findings include residence time of 8.3 min, the process temperature of 57.6 °C, the catalyst concentration of 2.2 g and residence time of 5 min, the process temperature of 63 °C, the catalyst concentration of 2.1 g for SFHR and RFHR respectively. At the predicted optimized process parameters, the observed and predicted biodiesel yield was 99.0% and 99.2% for SFHR and 99.9% and 99.8% for RFHR, respectively. These values experimentally verified the model accuracy. The batch and helical coil reactor processes were also compared for biodiesel production and found that helical coil reactors are 8–9 times more time efficient as compared to the batch reactor. © 2018

AB  - In Brazil, rural communities apart from large centers, distant from energy transmission and distribution grids, need electric energy, and this situation renders it difficult to ensure local economic progress. One alternative to solve the problem is energy generation using vegetal-oil-based fuels, made of local raw materials that are renewable and have a lower impact on the environment. The objective of the present work was to assess the performance and emissions of a diesel engine for energy generation that operated with soybean, linseed, and crambe vegetal-oil-based fuels. The fuels were tested in a 5-kVA generator engine at a load from 750 W to 3000 W. Biofuels were obtained from a mixture of conventional diesel oil with soybean, linseed, and crambe oil at incremental levels of 10%, 30%, 50%, and 70% of vegetal oil in the fuel mixture composition. The increase in soybean oil proportion at low load (750 W) resulted in lower specific consumption. At a high load (3000 W), there was a reduction in specific consumption when compared to conventional diesel fuels. Crambe biodiesel resulted in a reduction in emissions of CO, CO2, and NOx as function of the increase in crambe oil in the proportion. The results of these studies indicate that conventional diesel blends with low (10%) and medium (30%) concentrations of soybean, linseed, and crambe vegetal oil are viable technical solutions for the partial substitution of conventional diesel. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Differences in terminology associated with its use for transport purposes in both countries have been discussed, as well as the market-related aspects of such use, comparing, among other things, the scale of production and use in years 2010–2016 and presenting the results of research on attractiveness (value) of the market of transport biofuels (especially bioethanol) in Poland, which were compared to the perspectives of market development in Brazil. In Brazil, the share of renewable energy in total energy consumption is at the level of 42%, making it a world leader in use of energy from RES (renewable energy sources). 18% of the energy used is sugarcane bioenergy (bioethanol). At present, most of this production is being consumed by the domestic market, where ethyl alcohol is being sold as a pure ethanol fuel or mixed with gasoline. In Poland, the share of energy from renewable sources in end use of energy is 11.8%, and energy from liquid biofuels, including bioethanol, constitutes only 10.8% of this value. Although addition of bioethanol to gasoline available on the Polish market is acceptable, vehicles fueled with pure ethanol (like in Brazil) are not popular in Poland. The quantitative data presented indicates that the market of bioethanol in Poland, in relation to the Brazilian market of ethanol fuel, is very small. Production of this biofuel in Poland in year 2016 was almost 26 billion liters lower in comparison with Brazil. In 2007 the conventional biofuel sectors in Poland were considered to be relatively attractive components of the economy. In the case of methyl esters, the value of their production sector achieved the level of almost 68%, and of ethanol – almost 62%. The current results of research on the value of biofuel sectors in Poland are not encouraging in terms of investing in biofuels of this generation (conventional biofuels). Brazil has the longest history of success in terms of biofuels, in particular, bioethanol, however without a favorable taxation system, bioethanol is still more expensive than gasoline. According to forecasts, biodiesel production and consumption in Brazil are evolving in a linear manner, mainly due to the growing demand for fuel and the associated growth in the fleet of Brazilian vehicles and the perspective of increase of the biodiesel/diesel oil mix in the coming years. © 2018

AB  - The flash point of biofuels and petroleum fuels is an essential safety-related property for fuel processing, transportation and storage. Hydroprocessed renewable diesel (HRD-76) and synthesized isoparaffin (SIP), two biofuel blend stocks, were blended with commercial petroleum aromatic fluids (aromatic 100, 150 and 200) to investigate the impacts of aromatics on biofuel flash point and to formulate blends with identical flash point characteristics as NATO F-76 marine diesel and JP-5 jet fuel. To overcome the complexity of the fuel blends, COSMO-RS (“conductor like screening model for realistic solvation”) was employed to predict the flash point of these biofuel + aromatic systems. COSMO-RS calculated the flash point of alkanes and aromatics present in biofuel and petroleum fuels and the flash point of SIP + aromatics binary mixture systems. Based on the pure compound and binary mixture predictions, COSMO-RS calculations were expanded to develop surrogate mixtures for biofuels and aromatic fluids. The surrogates were in turn utilized to predict the flash point of biofuel blends with aromatics and to formulate blends with the same flash point as petroleum fuels. The COSMO-RS calculation also assisted the selection of aromatics suitable for blending with different biofuels. © 2018

AB  - Microwave-assisted pyrolysis of Camellia oleifera shell (COS) and stillingia oil (SO) was performed in the temperature range of 400–600 °C. The effects of feedstock and pyrolysis temperatures on product yield and bio-oil composition were discussed in detail. The bio-oil yield from COS pyrolysis varied from 37.30 wt% to 40.27 wt%, which was 11.32 wt% to 21.62 wt% lower than that from SO pyrolysis. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis indicated that SO bio-oil was rich in hydrocarbons, whereas COS pyrolysis produced mainly oxygen-containing compounds predominantly comprising phenols and acids. Fourier transform infrared and 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectra showed significant differences in the chemical structure of bio-oils from COS and SO pyrolysis. Elemental-composition and physical-property analyses further revealed that SO bio-oils were similar to gasoline and heavy fuel oil. © 2018

AB  - Here we investigate the inhibition capacity of cardanol for the corrosion of aluminum alloy 5052 H32 (AA 5052 H32) in biodiesel using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and weight loss methods. The results showed that the inhibition efficiency increases with an increase in the concentration of cardanol. The inhibitive action of cardanol is due to the adsorption of cardanol molecules on the AA 5052 H32 surface without the variation in the corrosion mechanism. The widening of phase angle maxima at an intermediate frequency by adding cardanol confirms the adsorption of a film of cardanol molecules on the AA 5052 H32 surface. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The limit of fossil fuels and more stringent emission standards have prompted the exploration of renewable biofuels and clean combustion technology. Clean and efficient combustion of liquid fuels mainly relies on spray fineness achieved by fuel injectors. Conventional injectors such as the air blast (AB) nozzles are only effective for low-viscosity fuels. Hence, viscous source oils of biofuels have to be converted into “drop-in” fuel such as biodiesel, leading to the high production cost of biofuels. In the past decade, the flow blurring (FB) injection using a two-phase flow concept has proved to generate fine sprays for even highly viscous liquids in the near field of injector exit, rather than a typical fuel jet from AB injectors. Thus, the FB injection has achieved cleaner burning of fossil fuels and enabled clean lean-premixed combustion of viscous oils including biodiesel source oils, signifying cost-effective biofuel utilization without the conversion cost. Recently, our group designed a novel twin-fluid swirl burst (SB) injector that integrates the advantages of FB and further improves secondary atomization caused by Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. The SB design innovatively introduces swirling atomizing air (AA) to stimulate more vigorous interaction between AA and large droplets or ligaments from the primary FB atomization by bubble-bursting. The present study compares the water spray micro-characteristics of FB and SB injectors in the near field of the injector exit at the same flow conditions using high spatial resolution particle image velocimetry and shadowgraph imaging systems. Results show that, compared to the FB atomization, the novel SB injector has successfully generated a wider spray with finer droplets immediately at the exit orifice and a shorter atomization completion length, indicating the improved secondary atomization. Estimate of Weber number and Ohnesorge number consistently substantiates the improved SB atomization and suggests bag breakup dominating the secondary atomization for both injectors. Radial profiles of Sauter Mean Diameter indicate the SB injection yields uniform droplet size distribution compared to the FB injection that has relatively larger droplets mainly at the spray periphery. Regardless of the variations in the atomizer near region, both SB and FB injector generate fine sprays with similar final droplet size. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Sand apple oil seed that has relatively high oil yield is widely cultivated in Africa. Evaluation of the performance of sand apple ethyl ester is a missing link in establishing it as an alternative fuel for use in diesel engines. Performance evaluation of optimized yields of sand apple biodiesel was, therefore, conducted in a diesel engine at various loading rates. Oil was extracted from sand apple seeds via solvent extraction. A Central Composite Design was used to optimize biodiesel yields from sand apple oil transesterification using potassium hydroxide as catalyst. Engine tests were carried out to evaluate the performance of a stationary 5Hp diesel engine starting from 0% to 100% load conditions. The engine was run with diesel and four different blends of diesel/biodiesel. Values for speed, torque, fuel consumption rate and exhaust temperature were determined. The optimum biodiesel yield recorded was 94.6%. The torque, speed, fuel consumption rate and exhaust temperature recorded for best engine performance for all blends were 8.50 Nm, 2950 rpm, 2.925 × 10−6 kg/s, and 300 °C. The evaluated engine parameters showed sand apple biodiesel can be burned in diesel engines using appropriate blending ratio without any modification to the engine. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The current study investigates the combustion performance of straight algae oil (AO) in a 7-kW lab-scale gas turbine burner enabled by a novel twin-fluid injector, named Swirl-burst (SB) injector. The chemical structure (fatty acid profile), the physical, and chemical properties of AO are acquired to understand the combustibility of the oil as a potential biofuel. Effects of equivalence ratio (ER) and atomizing air to liquid mass ratio (ALR) across the injector on the global combustion characteristics are investigated at a constant heat release rate for the oil. The features of interest include visual flame images, product gas temperature, emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) at the combustor exit. Results show that mono-unsaturated fatty acid is predominant in the composition of the oil, suggesting possibly short ignition delay. AO has a heating value comparable to that of diesel but with a high kinematic viscosity (approximately 16 times more viscous than diesel). Clean combustion highly depends on fine sprays that lead to fast fuel pre-vaporization, thorough fuel-air mixing, and thus clean premixed combustion. Conventional injectors such as air blast (AB) atomizers cannot finely atomize viscous oils for clean combustion due to the low viscosity tolerance. Fortunately, with the SB injection, clean, complete, and lean-premixed combustion of straight AO has been successfully achieved without fuel preheating at most of the investigated cases, reasonably reflecting the fine atomization capability of the SB injector even for the viscous oil. The blue flames, overlapping temperature profiles, and low emissions of CO and NOx consistently show the clean lean-premixed AO flames. Stable and clean flames are obtained at ERs of 0.60–0.75 (with the optimum ER identified at 0.65, in terms of flame stability and low emissions), and a blow-out limit at the ER of about 0.55. At the ER of 0.65, clean and lean-premixed flames are also acquired for all the tested ALRs (2.0–5.0). Increase in ALR varies the SAA and spray behavior of the SB injection as well as the aerodynamic interaction between fuel and oxidizer. The increasing ALR results in dominantly blue flames and decrease in CO and NOx concentrations, less than 10 ppm at ALRs > 2.5, due to finer atomization and better fuel-air mixing at the higher ALRs, and thus enhanced premixed combustion. Overall, clean and stable lean-premixed combustion of straight AO is achieved without fuel preheating using the novel SB injector despite the high fuel viscosity. The SB injection potentially enables AO itself as a cost-effective and near-zero-emission biofuel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present study, the ultrasound–assisted biodiesel production from mixed feedstock of non–edible oils in presence of KI impregnated ZnO as a catalyst in batch reactor was investigated. The production was optimized by using two approaches (1) feedstock optimization and (2) process parameters optimization. Various non–edible oils at optimum volumetric ratio were blended and used as feedstock for transesterification reaction. Biodiesel yield was optimized by Box–Behnken statistical design. The maximum triglyceride conversion of 92.35 ± 1.08% was achieved at optimized conditions of catalyst loading = 7% (w/w); alcohol/oil molar ratio = 11.68:1 and reaction temperature = 59 °C. Transesterification process with mechanical agitation was used as base case for identification of role of sonication in the process. The transesterification process was analysed for kinetic behaviour using pseudo first order kinetics and Eley–Rideal mechanism based model. Overall activation energy of transesterification process for mechanically agitated and ultrasound–assisted systems was calculated as 135.4 and 123.65 kJ/mol, respectively. However, the sum of activation energies of three reaction steps of Eley–Rideal mechanism (64.69 kJ/mol and 46.63 kJ/mol, for mechanically agitated and ultrasound–assisted system, respectively) was much lower. This discrepancy is attributed to mass transfer limitations in the system, even in presence of sonication. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The United States (US) Renewable Fuel Standard and California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard support the use of soy biodiesel and renewable diesel in the transport fuel supply for climate mitigation. However, linkages between the markets for soy oil and palm oil, which is associated with very high land use change emissions, could negatively affect the climate performance of soy-based biofuels. This study estimates the own and cross-price elasticities for the supply of soy and palm oils in the US using country-level data from 1992 to 2016 under rational expectations, through a seemingly unrelated regressions system of equations. We find a positive cross-price elasticity of palm oil import with respect to soy oil price and a positive reaction of supply of soy oil to increase in prices of palm oil. These results suggest that US biofuel policies may underestimate substitution between soy and palm oils and thus overestimate the climate benefits from soy-based biofuel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Medium voltage direct current (MVDC) is an emerging trend in ship power system to cater the growing power demand in modern navy applications. Marine diesel oil (MDO) is the primary fuel in the shipping sector. However, with rising oil prices and harmful emissions, there is a greater need than ever for ship operators to consider clean power generating options. Keeping this in mind, this paper aims to present a renewable energy solution through development and integration of a three-phase self-excited induction generator (SEIG)–based renewable biofuel generator in MVDC ship power system. A three-phase current controlled voltage source inverter (VSI) working as a static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) performs multiple tasks of harmonic elimination and regulation of the generated voltage under varying load. Gating pulses to the STATCOM switches are generated using indirect current theory-based controller. An integral sliding mode-controlled direct current to direct current (DC-DC) converter feeding ship service loads in MVDC shipboard system has taken as a nonlinear load. A laboratory prototype of the complete system has developed to validate the concept. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Continuous culture mode at the dilution rate D = 0.6 d−1, allowed higher biomass and lipid productivities of Picochlorum sp. than batch culture. When the biomass of outflow was transferred in stressful batch cultures, highest yields of lipids ranging from 499 to 698 g kg−1 (dw) were obtained under different nitrogen sources. The results indicated that highest polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) rates ranging from 68.7 to 78.8% were obtained under NaNO3 depletion, repletion, NaNO3 repletion, CO2 supplementation and NaH2PO4 depletion. Highest saturated fatty acids (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) rates ranging from 68.7 to 87.8% were obtained under phosphorus starvation and urea addition (-P + Ur), phosphorus starvation and ammonium addition (-P + Am), urea addition (Ur), ammonium addition (Am) and combined urea and ammonium addition (Ur + Am). Under (-P + Ur) and (-P + Am) stressful conditions, lipid profiles suitable for biodiesel production, were dominated by (C16:0 and C18:1). Results showed that combined nitrogen repletion and phosphorous depletion stress increased the synthesis of suitable fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) for biodiesel production. © 2018

AB  - The present study investigates biodiesel production from waste palm oil (WPO) using coconut coir husk (CCH) derived solid acid catalyst. The catalyst was prepared by the direct in-situ concentrated sulfuric acid impregnation. The presence of active sites, such as sulfonic, carboxylic, and phenolic OH functional groups on the catalyst was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The highest biodiesel yield of 89.8% was obtained under optimum conditions of 10 wt % catalyst, 12:1 methanol:oil (molar ratio), after 3 h at 130 °C and 500 rpm, in a laboratory autoclave reactor. It was found that biodiesel yield increases with increasing reaction temperature, reaction time, and catalyst loading, up to an optimum value. The catalyst can be reused for four cycles and the biodiesel yield was &gt;77%. Relatively higher activity may be due to the high acid density of the catalyst due to the presence of hydrophilic functional groups bonded to the hydrophobic carbon structure. It was found that, kinematic viscosity (2.9 mm2 s−1), pour point (−6 °C), heating value (38.1 MJ kg−1), and oxidation stability (3 h) of the produced biodiesel are in accordance with the international standards. Therefore, the produced biodiesel can be used. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work reports new experimental density data (816 points) for binary mixtures of dibutyl ether (DBE) + 1-heptanol over the composition range (5 compositions; 0.15 ≤ dibutyl ether mole fraction x ≤ 0.85), between 298.15 and 393.15 K, and for 23 pressures from 0.1 MPa up to 140 MPa. An Anton Paar vibrating tube densimeter, calibrated with an uncertainty of ±0.7 kg·m−3 was used to perform these measurements. The experimental density data were fitted with a Tait-like equation with low standard deviations. Excess volumes have been calculated from the experimental data. In addition, the isobaric thermal expansivity and the isothermal compressibility have been derived from the Tait-like equation, provided as supplementary material. In addition, PC-SAFT parameters of DBE and 1-heptanol were optimized using density data at atmospheric pressure. From PC-SAFT, density of mixture was reasonably well predicted with an average relative deviation varied between 0.00015% and 2.80%. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Exploration of non-edible oil as a feedstock and the use of new heterogeneous nanocatalyst could contribute to bioenergy research. In this regard, the present work is focussed on the use of cobalt doped zinc oxide nanocatalyst for production of biodiesel from Mesua ferrea oil. The synthesized catalyst has been analyzed through X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX), and Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) techniques. Under optimal reaction condition, maximum biodiesel conversion of 98.03% was obtained in 3 h at 60 °C with 2.5 wt% catalyst loading and 1:9 oil to methanol molar ratio. The produced biodiesel has been characterized using Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR), Carbon Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (13C NMR) and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS) techniques. Fuel properties of the produced biodiesel have also been determined. The result showed good catalytic activity of cobalt doped Zinc oxide nanocatalyst and could be used for large scale biodiesel production from Mesua ferrea oil by further enhancing its stability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel production using intensification of methyl ester is becoming very important due to its considerably lower energy requirement and shorter reaction time in obtaining feedstock oil. The present study investigated utilisation of Reutealis trisperma oil to produce biodiesel. A Box-Behnken experimental design was used to optimise the transesterification process. The process variables were explored and the optimum methanol to oil molar ratio, catalyst concentration, reaction temperature, and reaction time were 8:1, 1.2 wt%, 64 °C and 68 min respectively and the corresponding methyl ester yield was 98.39%. The experiment was conducted in triplicate to validate the quadratic model. Results showed average methyl ester yield was 97.78%, which is close to the predicted value, indicating reliability of the model. Results also indicated that using infrared radiation method has many advantageous, such as less energy consumption as a result of deeper penetration of reactant mass which can improve mass transfer between the immiscible reactants in order to improve quality of biodiesel. The physicochemical properties of Reutealis trisperma methyl ester produced under optimum transesterification process variables were also measured and the properties fulfilled the fuel specifications as per ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 standards. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - For converting biomass into renewable fuel, fast pyrolysis and further upgrading processes have been a promising pathway for years. Catalytic deoxygenation of the oxygenate compounds in the pyrolytic bio-oil significantly improves the quality of bio-oil and increases the possibilities of directly using that as transportation fuel. In this study, two types of experiment, fluidized bed fast pyrolysis of Miscanthus and hydro-processing of the produced bio-oil, were conducted in sequence. The Miscanthus biomass was first pyrolyzed to produce the bio-oil in a fluidized bed and the oil product was then hydro-processed into upgraded fuel in a fixed bed reactor over Pd/C catalyst with various operating conditions including reaction temperature, reaction pressure, liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV), and H2-to-oil ratio. The chemical compositions, FTIR spectra and physical/chemical properties of the two products were demonstrated and compared. The degree of deoxygenation (DOD) was additionally presented with varying experimental conditions, showing that the maximum DOD of 95% was obtained. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - 5-Na/ZnO loaded SBA-15 has been prepared by one-pot method in atmospheric conditions (without employing hydrothermal treatment) and following wet impregnation method. The prepared catalyst was characterised by using several techniques viz., BET method for determination of surface area, FE-SEM for morphology of catalyst, XPS study to determine the oxidation state of constituent elements. The catalyst was utilised for transesterification from virgin cotton seed oil and the catalyst activity was dependant on its basic strength. Under optimal reaction conditions of catalyst amount 12 wt%, methanol to oil molar ratio of 24:1 at reaction temperature of 65 °C, the prepared catalyst yielded &gt; 98% fatty acid methyl ester in 4 h of reaction duration. The catalyst was able to yield conversion level as good as ∼74% even in 5th cycle after regeneration. Leaching of &lt; 5 ppm metal content was observed, in 4th and 5th cycle, which was within the ASTM specified limitations. The thermodynamic parameters for the reaction, viz., activation energy Ea, ΔH‡, ΔS‡, ΔG‡ were calculated as 77.3 kJ mol−1, 74.2 kJ mol−1, -0.064 kJ mol−1 and, + 93.2 kJ mol−1 respectively. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fish oil is a sustainable, abundant, and low-cost raw material, as it is extracted from fish processing waste. This work suggests that fish oil is appropriate for biodiesel production and evaluates its potential through ethyl esters (EE). Initially, fish oil showed an acid value of 10.86 ± 0.05 mg KOH g−1. But after a neutralization reaction, the acid value was reduced to 0.68 ± 0.01 mg KOH g−1. Alkaline transesterification reactions were performed on a laboratory scale, using a central composite rotational design with three variables and a triplicate over the center point. We studied the appropriate concentrations of ethanol and catalysts, and the temperature that provide the best EE yield. The results showed the optimal condition is with 0.7% of a NaOH catalyst, a temperature of 54 °C, and an ethanol:oil molar ratio of 11.7:1. In such conditions, it was possible to acquire an EE yield of 96.4% with a low acid value of 0.32 ± 0.08 mg KOH g−1, which presented physicochemical properties consistent with the parameters by the Petroleum National Agency's (ANP). In the conditions studied, the results showed high levels of EE from the residual fish oil. This suggests that this raw material, rich in unsaturated fatty acid, can be beneficial for biodiesel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lipid extraction is a key step of biodiesel production from microalgae, however, the application of traditional extraction methods was limited due to the difficulties of cell disruption as well as solvent toxicity. In this work, pretreatment method using pulsed electric field (PEF), was primarily applied to lipid extraction process from microalgae Chlorella pyrenoidosa grown in wastewater. After the pretreatment with PEF, the yields of fatty acid methyl esters from C.pyrenoidosa was 12.0% higher than traditional pretreatment with ultrasonic. The results indicated that PEF was an effective method for cell disruption. Fluorescence staining and scanning electron microscopy showed that the integrity of the cell membrane of microalgae was damaged under pulsed electric field, which enhanced the penetration of solvents and lipid extraction. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Thermal degradation properties of stearic acid and its esterification derivants of methyl stearate and ethyl stearate are investigated through thermogravimetric analysis. Based on experiments, which are conducted at the temperature heated rates of 10, 15 and 20 K min−1, the iso-conversional methods of Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose and Flynn-Wall-Ozawa are used to calculate the apparent activation energy. Further, the Avrami theory is used to estimate the apparent reaction order. Apparent thermodynamic parameters of the apparent enthalpy change, apparent Gibbs free energy change and apparent entropy change are calculated. Calculations of apparent kinetic and thermodynamic parameters illustrate that thermal activity of stearic acid is distinctly heightened after esterification and the derived derivants are more easily activated. Meanwhile, influences of alcohol type on esterification products are weak. Conclusions from this study make more comprehensive understanding of the thermal events of biodiesel to be favor for its commercial application. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, Euonymus maackii Seed oil (EMSO) was exploited and evaluated for the ﬁrst time as a new non-edible oil feedstock for preparation of biodiesel. The EMSO yield was 41.06 ± 2.68 wt%. The fatty acid compositions of EMSO involved palmitoleic acid (2.01%), palmitic acid (14.5%), stearic acid (3.1%), oleic acid (49.8%), linoleic acid (29.3%), 11-Eicosenoic acid (0.1%) and arachidic acid (0.07%). Microwave-assisted transesteriﬁcation with methanol provided a high conversion yield in short duration under low temperature. The 2.0 wt% of catalyst amount, 10:1 of methanol/oil molar ratio, 40 min of reaction time and 60 °C of temperature were found to be the optimum process conditions for the maximum biodiesel yield of 94.74 ± 2.09%. Using pseudo first-order kinetic model, the reaction rate constants were 2.145 × 102, 3.550 × 102 and 6.447 × 102 min−1 for 40, 50 and 60 °C, respectively. The thermodynamic property for biodiesel preparation was determined as activation energy = 47.67 kJ/mol. The fuel properties of the biodiesel product were evaluated and comparable to ASTM D-6751 and EN 14214 standards. Overall, this study revealed and confirmed the potential of Euonymus maackii seed oil as the appropriate alternative feedstock for biodiesel production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - For biodiesel production from waste cooking oils with high acid values, an inefficient esterification pretreatment is always conducted to convert free fatty acids (FFAs) before alkali-catalysed transesterification process. In this paper, phosphotungstic acid based poly(ionic liquid) was prepared to catalyse the esterification of palmitic acid with methanol while the required catalyst dosage was much lower than commercial Amberlyst-15. And the catalyst was characterized by 31P CP-MAS NMR, FTIR, SEM, XRF and TG. Among the three poly(ionic liquid)s prepared in this paper, phosphotungstic acid based poly(ionic liquid) was selected to be the most suitable catalyst for esterification because the catalyst could be reused for more than 5 times without significant deactivation. According to single factor analyses, the esterification yield could reach 91.6% after 8 h while the reaction temperature, methanol to acid molar ratio and catalyst dosage were 65 °C, 6 and 3% wt, respectively. Afterwards, palmitic acid was proposed to be first adsorbed on the catalyst before reacting with methanol. Finally, a palmitic acid adsorbed Eley-Rideal model was employed to analyse the reaction and the adsorption mechanism was assumed as well. © 2018

AB  - The increasing demand for global energy and declining oil reserves have driven the search for alternative biofuel as fossil fuel replacement. This study proposes new blends of a light biofuel based on Melaleuca Cajuputi oil (MCO) and refined palm oil (RPO) that has lowered viscosities and densities properties as compared to neat RPO. In addition, a statistical approach using mixture design method was used in the design of experiment (DOE) to evaluate the correlation between the ratio of RPO-MCO blends on their kinematic viscosity and density properties. Based on the mixture design algorithm, a total of eight experimental runs were conducted consisting of three combinations of RPO-MCO blends, two neat oils and three replicate samples. A good fit between the developed model and the experimental data was obtained for the models of kinematic viscosity and density, with corresponding R2 values 0.9992 and 0.9998, respectively. Discrepancies in the predicted values to the experimental results were within 0.1–2.5%, validating the accuracy of the developed models. The optimal blend calculated is 32RPO68MCO which gives 5.9 mm2/s and 881.5 kg/m3 for the response values of kinematic viscosity and density, respectively. Both responses values satisfy the requirement of the ASTM D6751/EN14214 standard for biodiesel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, the effects of Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition (RCCI) application on engine combustion, performance and emissions in a diesel generator were investigated. In the experiments, safflower oil derived biodiesel and diesel mixtures were used as the high reactivity fuel (primary fuel) and gasoline as the low reactivity fuel. The RCCI application was provided by the connection of a secondary fuel injection system with the intake manifold. The gasoline RCCI application rate was 30% and 50% of the total mass fuel consumption of the engine and was pre-mixed as port fuel injection (PFI). Tests were performed at a constant engine load (10.8 kW) and engine speed of 1500 rpm. The purpose of using diesel and biodiesel mixtures is to increase the reactivity of the primary fuel that facilitates the start of the combustion. The combustion, performance and emissions, which are the most important parameters of the engine operation, have been thoroughly investigated and the results were presented. In RCCI application, in peak values of pressure, velocity of heat release, average gas temperature partial increases were determined. When the ratio of gasoline PFI was increased, the NOx emissions significantly decreased and the engine efficiency was also increased, while the CO and HC emissions were slightly increased. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A comparison of different inorganic and organic flocculants at doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg/L was performed to achieve the maximum biomass harvesting of Nannochloropsis gaditana microalgae. The best results were reached by aluminium chloride with 90.9 ± 0.2% biomass recovered followed by copper sulphate with 70.8 ± 0.3% at the maximum doses used. If the behaviour is analysed after spending 24 h, all flocculants recovered more than 90% algal biomass. In the oil extraction process, a maximum of 29.25 ± 1.10% extracted oil was achieved by Soxhlet using methanol-chloroform 2:1 as solvent and applying previous disruption by microwave. 20.4% less oil was released when n-hexane was used. Ultrasound extraction assisted by microwave reached peak values of 22.60 ± 1.03%. Methyl esters of saturated fatty acids (C14:0, C16:0 and C18:0) were found as the major constituents, accounting for about 70% of the total content. Direct transesterification with previous incubation accomplished higher biodiesel conversions than without it. Finally, pellet manufacturing from algal wastes obtained after the transesterification reaction was studied. The results indicated that these pellet should be mixed with another type of biomass (e.g., miscanthus or eucalyptus) to be used as fuel in biomass boilers. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study compares the performance of a thermal power plant fired by natural gas to that fired by biodiesel blend, from exergetic and economic perspectives. A thermodynamic model has been developed to predict the performance of a running plant and was used to conduct the comparative study. Plant life of 25 years has been used to assess the viability of the gas turbine power plant by analyzing the net present cost and the break-even point for both fuels. The plant specific fuel consumption for natural gas fired and biodiesel blend fired are 0.3151 [kg/kWh] and 0.3884 [kg/kWh] respectively. The system fired by natural gas only, has a payback period of 1.9 years, internal rate of return of 52% and exhaust temperature of 915.74 [K], while that fired by the biodiesel blend has a payback period of 2.4 years, internal rate of return of 60% and exhaust temperature of 858.50 [K]. Nevertheless, biodiesel blend is preferable because it is biodegradable, produces less emissions, and as a consequence, environmentally benign. Biodiesel blend would be more suitable for firing gas turbine engines, if the combustor is redesigned to improve its efficiency. Thermo-economic analysis of gas turbine power plants is essential to improve its thermodynamic and economic performance. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The oil plants provide a sufficient source of renewable lipid production for alternative fuel and chemical supplies as an alternative to the depleting fossil source, but the environmental effect from these plants’ cropping is a concern. The high oleic acid (OA; C18:1) content in plant-derived products provide advantages of multiple uses with improved oxidative stability and a wide range of applicable temperature. Here we used a promising lipid producer, the oleaginous yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides, to attempt to obtain an OA-enriched lipid. Saccharomyces cerevisiae OLE1 (ScOLE1) gene encodes Δ9 fatty acid desaturase (Δ9FAD), which is generally known to synthesize palmitoleic acid (POA; C16:1) and OA, but the functions of putative R. toruloides Δ9FAD gene are not well understood. In a complementary test, the RtΔ9FAD gene rescued the survival of an OA-deficient Scole1Δ mutant, and we introduced the RtΔ9FAD gene into R. toruloides strains for the production of OA-enriched lipid. Increasing lipid production was observed in ScOLE1 and genomic RtΔ9FAD gene-overexpressing R. toruloides strains. The ScOLE1 transformant output fivefold more OA content in total amount, with >70% of total lipid. Different enhancing effects from the protein coding sequence and genomic sequence of RtΔ9FAD genes were also observed. Overall, this study resulted in ScOLE1 and RtΔ9FAD gene overexpression in R. toruloides to obtain OA-enriched lipid as a candidate source of designed biodiesel and lipid-related chemicals. © 2018 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan

AB  - A novel procedure that uses FTIR-ATR C[dbnd]O signal area (1690–1800 cm−1) and a standard test method that is used for determination of fatty acid methyl ester in diesel were applied for the quantification of ethyl, propyl, butyl, isobutyl, pentyl, isopenyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, decyl, and dodecyl fatty acid esters in diesel. These methods were examined in the range from 0.0 to 30.0 vol% of biodiesel in diesel. The obtained correlation between concentration and FTIR absorption was highly linear (R2 above 0.993, in most cases 0.999). Considering that diesel blends with butanol or higher alcohols with their corresponding fatty acid alkyl ester can satisfy the requirements for use in diesel engines, we tested if such blending would influence the results of those two methods. The results indicate that biodiesel can be quantified for blends with alcohol content up to 9 vol% of the total volume when signal area calibration is used. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel production was stimulated in Brazil by the National Program for Production and Use of Biodiesel. The program has two objectives: ensuring both production and domestic consumption of biodiesel; and promoting diversification of feedstock sources, social inclusion, and regional development by generating employment and income for small rural farmers. However, despite the great potential for diversification of oilseed raw materials, soybeans make up the majority of the raw material that feeds the Brazilian biodiesel supply chain. Soybeans have two advantages: meeting the domestic demand for biodiesel; and having the most competitive prices, compared to other raw materials. Soybeans also support the social aspect of the federal program, although productive arrangements with small farmers are concentrated in the South region of Brazil. This paper characterizes the “social soybean” production chain for biodiesel production in Brazil and describes some of the competitive drivers that explain how soybeans from small farmers have been established as the main feedstock source. The paper also describes some bottlenecks and suggests actions that might address them in order to contribute to increased competitiveness of soybeans from small farmers in biodiesel production in Brazil. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Brønsted acidic ionic liquid (BAIL) functionalized hierarchically porous nitrogen-doped carbons (NHPCs) with interesting 3D interconnected macro-meso-microporous structure are successfully prepared by chemical bonding ‒[C3][SO3CF3−] (C3 = PrSO3H) groups throughout the NHPC supports that are obtained via a single step CaCO3 nanoparticle-directed nanocasting approach combined with K2C2O4 chemical activation and urea/melamine self-activation during the process of carbonization of glucose and urea/melamine. By changing initial urea-to-glucose weight ratio in the preparation systems, the macro/meso/micropore proportion of the resulting GU‒[C3N][SO3CF3] catalysts are well-adjusted. The morphological characteristics, porosity properties and chemical structure of the prepared catalysts are well-characterized so that the contribution of the synergistic effect of CaCO3 nanoparticle and K2C2O4 to the formation of hierarchically porous structure is revealed. Owing to super strong Brønsted acidity and unique hierarchically porous structure of the catalysts, they exhibit excellent heterogeneous acid catalytic activity in raw pyrolysis biofuel upgrading via esterification of acetic acid with high boiling point benzyl alcohol or 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol in toluene media, and therefore high acetic acid removal efficiency and efficient production of value-added benzyl acetate or 4-methoxybenzyl acetate are obtained simultaneously. The catalysts also show good reusability in target reactions, attributing to chemical interactions between BAILs and NHPC supports. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This experimental study was conducted to explore the favorable and unfavorable conditions which promote or reduce the performance and emissions in a diesel engine, based on six engine loads (5% to 95% load) and five biodiesel contents including B0 (0% waste cooking oil biodiesel and 100% diesel, by volume %), B20, B50, B75 and B100 (pure biodiesel), at a constant engine speed of 1920 rpm. According to the results, the maximum brake specific fuel consumption was recorded at the lowest engine load (5% load) using B100; while the highest brake thermal efficiency was obtained at 80% load for B100. In regard to regulated emissions, the highest engine load (95% load) with diesel fuel was the condition for the formation of maximum CO, smoke opacity, PM mass, total particle number concentration and geometric mean diameter. The 95% load with B100 was the condition for maximum CO2 and NOX. The 60% load with diesel fuel was the condition for maximum THC. For unregulated emissions, low engine load with B100 was the condition for maximum formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, ethene and propene. The maximum 1,3-butadiene was observed for B100 at 80% load. The highest benzene emission was recorded at 40% load for B100. The maximum toluene and xylene emissions were found at 5% load for diesel fuel. In addition, the conditions which lead to produce the minimum emissions are also extensively discussed in the present study. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ethyl levulinate (EL), a biofuel additive for petroleum and biodiesel can also be used as a 100% fuel to replace petroleum diesel with the existing diesel engine. The major problem to make the EL process economical is the lack of a proper conversion technology to convert C6 sugars such as glucose with higher yield of EL as well as process which can tolerate higher glucose concentration to increase productivity. The present study highlighted the catalytic synthesis of EL from glucose over synergetic combination of zeolite H-USY and Lewis acidic catalysts such as Sn-beta, TiO2, ZrO2, and SnO2. Because of the strong Lewis acidic nature and the subsequent enhancement in the isomerization rate from glucosides to fructosides, the synergetic combination of H-USY with SnO2 showed higher EL yield than the combination with other Lewis acidic catalysts. So far, the highest EL yield of 81% from glucose (50 g/L) at 180 °C in 3 h was achieved over the optimal combination of 95% H-USY and 5% SnO2 having strong/weak acidity and B/L ratios of 1.30 and 0.75, respectively. The study was further extended for establishing the proposed reaction mechanism without the formation of 5-hydroxymethyl furfural, levulinic acid, and formic acid which makes the overall process clean and green. © Copyright 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This work aims at combusting a high viscous high cetane biofuel completely and efficiently under dual combustion mode using another low viscous low cetane biofuel. Maduca longifolia oil (MO) was selected as the base fuel. Combustion was achieved by using EFI (electronic fuel injection) and carburetion of eucalyptus oil at the intake manifold. Eucalyptus oil was also blended externally with MO at different mass ratios and tested. A comparison of engine results was made at 100% and 40% loads (power outputs) for all the attempts. Test results indicated significant improvement in BTE (brake thermal efficiency) with all modes with moderate energy shares of eucalyptus oil. The BTE increased from 25.2% with neat MO operation to a maximum of 29%, 32.3%, and 33.4% respectively with eucalyptus oil addition, carburetion, and EFI modes whereas it was observed as 30.8% with ND (neat diesel). Smoke was reduced with eucalyptus oil addition, carburetion, and EFI at the maximum efficiency points at 100% load. Peak pressure and energy-release rate indicated as superior to neat MO at all modes mainly at 100% load. Thirty percent, 40.2%, and 30.4% respectively with eucalyptus oil addition, carburetion, and EFI were recommended to be the optimal mass shares for 100% load. EFI of eucalyptus oil could be preferred for the highest BTE, lowest smoke, and NO emissions and maximum replacement of MO for the optimal operation of the engine among the methods tested. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Concerns over the depletion of conventional fuels have increased interest in new renewable energy sources like alcohol- and vegetable-based oils. Major drawbacks of using esters of vegetable oils, known as biodiesel, include reduced engine performance and increased emissions of oxides of nitrogen. In the present study, the effects of ethanol on biodiesel and mineral diesel blends in a diesel engine are experimentally investigated. The ethanol is produced from cashew apple juice by fermentation. Experiments are conducted using B20 Pongamia biodiesel with ethanol in proportions of 5, 7.5, and 10% by volume at varying load conditions. The results indicate that a B20 biodiesel blend with 7.5% ethanol yields a higher brake thermal efficiency and lower brake-specific energy consumption than pure B20 (20% biodiesel + 80% diesel), as well as significantly reduced emissions such as oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and smoke. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Biodiesel has been renowned as potential and alternative fuel for years. In order to improve the quality of the conventional fossil fuels, biodiesel, and air pollution from combustion, additives are essential to exploit. In this study, the uses of cerium oxide (CeO 2 ) nanoparticle additive for B20 fuel in a diesel engine are investigated. The CeO 2 nanoparticles with cetyl-trimethyl ammonium bromide are doped into the B20 fuel by using ultrasonicator. The purpose of the experimental work was adopted to enhance engine combustion and reduce the emissions with an approach of CeO 2 nanoparticle additive. The experiment was conducted on a diesel engine using different propagation of CeO 2 nanoparticle in blended mahua methyl ester fuel such as B20 + CeO 2 50 ppm, B20 + CeO 2 100 ppm, and B20 + CeO 2 150 ppm. The obtained results are compared with the diesel and B20 fuels. The minor changes are obtained in B20 fuel properties due to the addition of CeO 2 nanoparticles. The performance of brake thermal efficiency and combustion of pressure data is observed to be enhanced by the addition of a metal-based additive. The CO, HC, and smoke are decreased for B20 fuel with nanoparticles. The NO x is reduced by dosing the CeO 2 due to the oxidation of unburned CeO 2 in the exhaust. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The study was conducted to analyse the influence of three nutrient formulations, namely BG-11 medium, BBM and TAP medium, on growth potential and lipid yield of two microalgal genera (Botryococcus sp. and Chlorella sp.) and to study the roles of N, P and other major nutrients. The study focussed on the general patterns of starch and lipid synthesis and storage and to further assess how photosynthetic carbon partitioning into starch and lipid is altered by conditions in growth media such as N and C presence as seen in BG11 medium which are known to induce neutral lipid production and the lack of it in BBM and TAP medium. BG-11 medium performed better as compared to BBM and TAP medium in terms of biomass productivity and lipid yield. The lipid yield was highest in Botryococcus sp. (63.03% dry wt.) and Chlorella sp. (50.27% dry wt.) at 30th day of incubation. Mean biomass productivity was highest for Botryococcus in BBM medium (6.14 mg/L/day) and for Chlorella in BG-11 medium (4.97 mg/L/day). Mean lipid productivity (50.78% and 39.36%) was highest in BG11 medium for both Botryococcus and Chlorella species, respectively. A sharp decline in sugar content was observed in the late stationary phase of growth from 30th day to 45th day. Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profile of the extracted lipids showed predominantly oleic acid, followed by palmitic acid and stearic acid in both the strains when grown in BG-11 medium. The other biodiesel quality parameters were in accordance with the international standards. A complex relationship was found between chemical composition and biodiesel properties. Proximity analysis indicated that the fuel properties of biodiesels are determined by a number of parameters and by the combination of different chemical compositions. The results provide an insight into organic carbon partitioning into lipid compounds and how the organism’s lipid metabolism changes due to N-deplete culturing in TAP medium and inorganic carbon source availability as seen in BG-11 and BBM medium. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - As an effort to develop affordable and sustainable energy sources, algae-derived biofuels have attracted considerable interest. As use of individual conversion processes targeting a subset of biochemical components (e.g., extraction and upgrading of lipids) has been shown to be economically unfeasible, there is a recognized need for integrated conversion systems that can valorize algal feedstocks with varying cell compositions. In this study, two hybrid systems (HBD-1, HBD-2) are proposed to enable more efficient conversion of all biomass components (lipids, proteins, carbohydrates) by leveraging two complementary systems: direct hydrothermal liquefaction (DHTL) and combined algal processing (CAP). Demonstrative experiments with Scenedesmus acutus show a 12.2-34.3% increase in fuel yields relative to individual systems (DHTL, CAP). Subsequent modeling efforts reveal substantial improvements stemming from CAP valorization of carbohydrates and lipids and DHTL valorization of proteins and CAP residuals. The maximum biomass-to-fuel conversion efficiencies for lipids/proteins/carbohydrate cell components are 79%/34%/75% (HBD-2), and techno-economic analysis suggests a 3.2-62.1% reduction in minimum fuel selling prices (MFSPs). The increased fuel yields and reduced MFSPs highlight the flexibility of the hybrid systems for biofuel production, revealing advantages of these systems for broader ranges of feedstocks, including ones not traditionally considered for fuel production.

AB  - Biogas resulting from anaerobic digestion can be utilized for the production of liquid fuels via reforming to syngas followed by the Fischer-Tropsch reaction. Renewable liquid fuels are highly desirable due to their potential for use in existing infrastructure, but current Fischer-Tropsch processes, which require operating pressures of 2 4 MPa (20 40 bar), are unsuitable for the relatively small scale of typical biogas production facilities in the EU, which are agriculture-based. This paper investigates the feasibility of producing liquid fuels from biogas-derived syngas at atmospheric pressure, with a focus on the system's response to various interruption factors, such as total loss of feed gas, variations to feed ratio, and technical problems in the furnace. Results of laboratory testing showed that the liquid fuel selectivity could reach 60% under the studied conditions of 488 K (215 °C), H2/CO = 2 and 0.1 MPa (1 bar) over a commercial Fischer Tropsch catalyst. Analysis indicated that the catalyst had two active sites for propagation, one site for the generation of methane and another for the production of liquid fuels and wax products. However, although the production of liquid fuels was verified at atmospheric pressure with high liquid fuel selectivity, the control of such a system to maintain activity is crucial. From an economic perspective, the system would require subsidies to achieve financial viability. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The main focus of the work is to study Chlorella pyrenoidosa mediated photoautotrophic production of lipid in a bubble column photobioreactor using CO 2 as carbon source under natural diurnal outdoor sunlight. The limiting and inhibiting concentrations of CO 2 in sparging gas, nitrogen inhibition, reversibility of the CO 2 inhibition on growth, and lipid production have been investigated under natural sunlight. A process model coupled with light distribution inside the culture has been developed considering different concentration of dissolved CO 2 and urea, repression of nitrogen on lipid production under natural sunlight diurnal in nature in a bubble column reactor. The biomass titer of 4.6 g/L with 10% CO 2 has been achieved within 5 days of culture under sunlight. A two stage photoautotrophic lipid production strategy in a sintered disc bubble column photobioreactor under natural sunlight has been developed. 30% (w/w-DCW) lipid within 5 days of lipid induction period has been achieved. The biomass productivity of 0.91 ± 0.01 gm/L/day in growth period with sufficient urea and lipid productivity of 410 ± 12 mg/L/day in last 2 days of urea starvation period have been achieved in outdoor photoautotrophic cultivation under natural sunlight using CO 2 as carbon source. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The Bio-oil was produced from the pyrolysis of agricultural wastes (Eucalyptus sawdust) and discarded soybean frying oil. The temperature of the pyrolysis system was initiated at 28°C and increased to 850°C. Atmospheric distillation of crude bio-oil was performed and a fraction at a temperature range 160–240°C (pyrolysis oil) was separated and subjected to GC-MS, 1 H-NMR, TGA and FTIR analysis to identify the different properties and compounds present in pyrolysis oil. It was noticed that there was an abundance of oxygen and nitrogen containing compounds as well as other reactive species in pyrolysis oil. To reduce the amount of these species, the pyrolysis oil was subjected to hydrogenation in the presence of NiMo as a catalyst. After hydrogenation, the atmospheric distillation of hydrogenated bio-oil was performed and another fraction at temperature range 160–240°C (hydrogenated bio-oil) was separated and analyzed by the same techniques. It was noticed that during hydrogenation, more than 60% oxygenated and other reactive species were converted into hydrocarbons. Hydrogenated bio-oil showed very similar physico-chemical properties such as distillation curve, density, viscosity, freezing point, flash point, the presence of hydrocarbons and enthalpy of combustion as aviation kerosene also known as QAV-1. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Increased NOx emission from usage of biodiesel is a burning issue to be dealt with. Many techniques have been adopted to reduce NOx emissions from diesel engines. The present experimental study deals with the analysis of performance and emission characteristics of Cotton Seed oil biodiesel with the addition of natural antioxidant extract of clove. FTIR analysis characterized the antioxidant by the presence of hydroxyl groups denoted by the corresponding wave number. The oxidation stability of the test samples was determined in terms of induction period by means of Rancimat test. The induction periods of the test fuel samples B100, B20, B20+CL1000, and B20+CL2000 were found to be 2.20 h, 2.73 h, 10.19 h, and 11.12 h, respectively. Thus, the addition of Clove antioxidant increased the oxidation stability of the biodiesel. Results show that the addition of antioxidant to biodiesel blend has increased the Brake Thermal Efficiency to a maximum of 4.71% and decreased the Brake Specific Fuel Consumption to a maximum of 6.25% at full-load conditions compared to Cotton Seed biodiesel blend. The addition of Clove extract antioxidant at a concentration of 1000 ppm and 2000 ppm decreases the NOx emission by 23.03% and 26.7%, respectively, at full-load conditions. However, CO emissions increased by 1.12% and 4.49% with the addition of CL1000 and CL2000 to B20, respectively. Similarly, HC emissions increased by 4.19% and 7.35% by the addition of CL1000 and CL2000 to B20, respectively. The increases in smoke with the addition of CL1000 and CL2000 to B20 were 42.48% and 47.71%, respectively. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - A comprehensive exergoeconomic performance analysis of a municipal solid waste digestion plant integrated with a biogas genset was conducted throughout this study in order to highlight its bottlenecks for further improvements. Exergoeconomic performance parameters of each component of the plant were determined by solving exergy and cost balance equations based on Specific Exergy Costing (SPECO) approach. The analysis was conducted to reveal the cost structure of the plant based on actual operating information and economic data. The exergy unitary cost of two main products of the plant, i.e., bioelectricity and biofertilizer were determined at 26.27 and 2.27 USD/GJ, respectively. The genset showed the highest overall cost rate (101.27 USD/h) followed by digester (68.41 USD/h). Furthermore, the net bioelectricity amounted to 67.81% of the overall cost rate of the products, while this value was 32.19% for both liquid and dewatered digestates. According to the results obtained, efforts should mainly focus on enhancing the efficiency of the genset in order to boost the overall performance of the system exergoeconomically. In addition, minimizing the investment-related cost of the digester could also substantially enhance the exergoeconomic performance of the plant. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present paper presents an assessment of the techno-economic performance of novel polygeneration concepts for bio-oil production. They are based on catalytic hydropyrolysis and hydrodeoxygenation, and can be integrated with other processes for co-production of synthetic natural gas, molecular hydrogen and methanol. Thirteen system layouts were evaluated considering different technological alternatives and process pathways. Firstly, detailed thermodynamic and economic models were developed to calculate and compare the energy demands, capital and production costs of all plants, given a biomass input of 2000 dry metric tonnes per day. Sensitivity analyses using local approaches, Morris screening and multi-variable linear regression tools were then conducted to identify the essential parameters. Finally, uncertainty analyses were performed to estimate the minimum selling price of bio-oil for each case. The results show that the total capital costs range between $180 and $620 million, for a production cost between $17 and $24 per GJ of fuel. The feedstock and electricity costs represent the greatest share (up to 60% together) followed by the annualised investment costs (up to 18%). The sensitivity analyses suggest that the plant profitability is mostly impacted by the bio-oil yield, by-product characteristics, electrolysis costs, wood and power prices. The uncertainty analysis, through Monte-Carlo simulations, demonstrates that the minimum fuel selling prices may vary from $-3 to $240 per GJ. The most promising layouts are those with SNG and H2 production, whilst the riskiest ones are those with electrolysis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgae is an alternative feedstock for biofuel production and has been considered to be a potential biotechnology. However, the systems for industrial biofuel production from microalgae are still costly and unsuitable. In addition, the complex and changeable processes contained in different bioenergy conversion systems make it difficult to reasonably compare these systems. This study aim to obtain an optimal microalgae-based industrial system using life-cycle assessment, and to unify the uncertainties caused by the discrepancies of each process. Two types of bioenergy conversion systems were modelled and compared: (1) transesterification, hydrothermal liquefaction, and pyrolysis for renewable diesel production and (2) anaerobic digestion without/with hydrothermal pretreatment for biogas production. The life-cycle impacts of these systems were quantified in terms of net energy ratios (NERs) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The results show that anaerobic digestion system with hydrothermal pretreatment is more industrially feasible and eco-friendly at the industrial scale due to its low NER (0.71) and GHG emissions [−60.84 g CO2−eq (MJ biogas)−1]. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

The tribology results revealed that B50 showed the lowest steady-state coefficient of friction (SSCOF) amongst all the other blends. SSCOF of B100 is 23.27% more than B50. Similarly, SSCOF of B90, B60, B20, B10, and diesel are 19%, 8%, 17.23%, 31.9% and 40.11% greater than the SSCOF of B50 respectively. Wear scar diameter (WSD) results also showed that B50, B60, B90, and B100 have lower WSD of around 0.6 mm. Diesel showed the highest WSD of 0.8 mm. Flash temperature parameter (FTP) is inversely related to WSD, and thus B50, B60, B90, and B100 exhibited higher FTP of around 80. On evaluating the corrosion characteristics, B50 exhibited lesser corrosion inducing capability compared to all the other blends. Experimental investigation of the engine showed that B100 yielded lesser thermal efficiency and higher specific fuel consumption than diesel. The CO, HC, NO, and smoke emissions were minimum for B100 when compared to diesel. Finally, all the results revealed that B100 is the ideal blend that can perform efficiently and be a sustainable energy source for diesel engines. © 2019

AB  - A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is a high-efficiency technology for combined heat and power (CHP) generation. Heat and power production can be varied according to changes in heat and power loads, which affect the electrical and thermal efficiencies. This study analyzes changes in heat and power production rates of a bio-oil sorption enhanced steam reforming (SESR) and SOFC system. The variations in the stack-to-burner ratio (bio-oil split fractions), fuel utilization factor (Uf), and recirculation ratio (R) are investigated. The effect of heat-to-power ratio on the system performance and CO2 capture efficiencies is also studied. Moreover, the benefit of the implementation of a bio-oil SESR and SOFC system over a conventional operation to match the energy demand for an industrial case is evaluated. The results reveal that an increase in Uf decreases the operating range of the heat-to-power ratio. On the other hand, the anode gas recirculation ratio affects such a parameter when the system performs at the high stack-to-burner ratio. A higher heat-to-power ratio increases the stack electrical and thermal efficiencies, leading to a higher CHP efficiency. The heat-to-power ratio of the proposed system varies between 0.05 and 7.5. However, to attain a CO2 capture efficiency higher than 50%, the heat-to-power ratio should be lower than 1.5. By comparing the two operational strategies: fixed heat-to-power ratio, and variable heat-to-power ratio, it is found that the heat-to-power ratio is an important factor for energy management. The primary energy saving is enhanced when the system is operated to satisfy the rates of heat and power demand. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bio-oils have been known with some advantages such as biodegradability, renewable, oxygen content, no-sulfur content. However, high viscosity, high surface tension and density due to the large structure may be the main causes strongly affecting the spray characteristics, mixture formation, combustion process, and emission characteristics of diesel engines running on bio-oils. In this work, the evaluation of the relationship between the spray parameters of used bio-oils including spray penetration (S) and cone angle (ɸ), and preheating temperature compared to fossil diesel fuel was conducted. Besides, the influence of the spray parameters on the breakup mechanism, brake thermal efficiency (ηe), heat release rate (HRR), and emission characteristics of an 80hp-diesel engine was reported. As a result, pure bio-oil was preheated to 105 °C to achieve the similarity of some physical properties and spray parameters compared to diesel fuel, but emission parameters of carbon monoxide (CO) and unburnt hydrocarbon (UHC) were 23.10% and 23.36% respectively higher. Meanwhile, brake thermal efficiency (ηe), and emissions of CO2, NOx, smoke were 3.36%, and 12.00%, 8.86%, 48.48% respectively lower than those of fossil diesel fuel. The findings in this paper showed further evidence in the direct use of pure biodiesel as a fuel for diesel engines. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Spray mixing and combustion processes are regarded as the major factors that determine the energy conversion efficiency and emission level of internal combustion engines. However, the related researches mainly rely on 3D flow simulation or optical engine experiments, which are highly expensive and time-consuming. In order to provide a more convenient solution, this paper developed a one-dimensional semi-phenomenological model to achieve accurate and efficient predictions on spray combustion characteristics. The model was constructed by a dimensionless spray theoretical model and limited experimental data of macroscopic spray characteristics. Inside the proposed model, a physical module was used to physical module spray air-fuel mixing conditions like fuel distribution and evaporation. Besides, an improved Arrhenius-typed correlation concerning injection parameters and environment variables was introduced to describe the chemical ignition characteristic of spray combustion. The optical experiment results showed that this method is simple and effective, and the forecasting is satisfactory. Based on the new model, the influences of blending n-pentanol on the spray combustion characteristics of diesel and biodiesel were investigated. On the physical aspect, the critical fuel concentration at liquid length position decreases with n-pentanol is blended into both fuels in the most cases, but witnessed a significant leap in 1200 K condition, especially for diesel blends; the physical ignition delay times of both diesel and biodiesel blends decreases first and go up later. On the chemical aspect, the join of n-pentanol caused the gap between the physical delay time and the chemical delay time much narrower, but the ignition patterns were different in diesel blends and biodiesel blends. Moreover, this paper proposed a series of correlations focused on the liquid length and ignition delay of n-pentanol blends sprays. These correlations covered wide conditions and showed better prediction accuracy than traditional ones. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Auto-ignition characteristics of a butanol-hexadecane droplet were researched under ambient gauge pressures of 5 and 10 bar and ambient temperatures of 553, 633 and 713 K. Butanol-hexadecane blends of 0%, 25% and 50% n-butanol by mass (hereafter denoted by BUT'XX′) were tested in a bilayer-structure chamber (BSC). Five sub-stages were observed, namely stable evaporation, faint partially premixed combustion, bright partially premixed combustion, diffusion combustion and droplet falling. Faint partially premixed combustion and droplet falling were observed under elevated pressures but not under atmospheric pressure. The temperature growth rate was generally different in these sub-stages. Four different temperature growth rates were found under 633 K and 5 bar, while only three different temperature growth rates were found under 713 K and 5 bar. The auto-ignition delay was negatively correlated with ambient pressure and temperature. The auto-ignition delay of BUT25 was shorter than that of BUT00 and BUT50 under 633 K and 5 bar, while the increase of n-butanol led to the increase of auto-ignition delay under 633 K and 10 bar. The auto-ignition distance reflected the transportation of fuel vapor in the auto-ignition delay. The auto-ignition distance changed in a similar manner with the auto-ignition delay. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The computational treatment of detailed kinetic reaction mechanisms for combustion is expensive, especially in the case of biodiesel fuels. In this way, great efforts in the search of techniques for the development of reduced kinetic mechanisms have been observed. As Methyl Butanoate (MB, C 3 H 7 COOCH 3 ) is an essential model frequently used to represent the ester group of reactions in saturated methyl esters of large chain, this paper proposes a reduction strategy and uses it to obtain a reduced kinetic mechanism for the MB. The reduction strategy consists in the use of artificial intelligence to define the main chain and produce a skeletal mechanism, apply the traditional hypotheses of steady-state and partial equilibrium, and justify these assumptions through an asymptotic analysis. The main advantage of the strategy employed here is to reduce the work required to solve the system of chemical equations by two orders of magnitude for MB, since the number of reactions is decreased in the same order. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The key to sustainable and commercially viable biodiesel production relies primarily on species selection. Oleaginous species with high biomass productivity, lipid content, and lipid productivity are desirable. High growth rate of the species results in high biomass productivity, which leads to high lipid productivity. It is known that algal oil technology lacks commercial feasibility predominantly due to low biomass productivity and other factors. The use of a faster-growing organism, such as oleaginous bacteria, could offset this major disadvantage. Thus, the current study analyzes two model oleaginous systems: Rhodococcus opacus PD630 (a bacterium) and Chlorella vulgaris NIOT5 (a microalga) for their growth rate and lipid productivity. It was found that the bacterial growth rate was 25-fold the microalgal growth rate. The bacterium also showed 57-fold higher biomass productivity and 75-fold higher biodiesel productivity. Further, the analysis of a large number of literature data from relevant studies under different cultivation conditions showed that R. opacus PD630 has productivities far higher than various autotrophic microalgae. Similarly, a frequency distribution of data collected from the literature showed that Rhodococcus sp. has productivities in the higher range as compared to heterotrophic microalgae. Thus, bacteria could serve as a better alternative to microalgae toward developing a commercially viable biofuel technology. Further, the biodiesel characterization study showed that the quality of diesel from the bacterium was better than that from the microalga. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Drought-tolerant, industrial oilseeds such as Camelina sativa (camelina) grown on marginal land are being considered as feedstock alternatives to meet the increasing biofuel demand and reduce the dependency on water and food resources. However, crops grown on rural, marginal lands are not well-connected with transportation networks and biofuel plants. Transportation routes and biofuel plant development should be optimized for sustainable biofuel development. This study aimed at developing a supply chain optimization model for biodiesel produced from camelina oilseed. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model associated with geographic information system (GIS) was built. Three echelons of camelina oilseed supply, biodiesel production, and biodiesel and by-product (livestock meal) demand were considered to optimize the numbers, locations, and capacities of new plants, transportation routes, and the utilization rate of existing plants at a minimum cost. A case study was conducted for the northern Great Plains (NGP) region of Montana, South Dakota, and North Dakota. Transportation cost compared to plant construction cost was a decisive factor in supply chain configuration. The model developed in this study simulates minimum cost transportation routes directly through the GIS network analysis, which is differentiated from other studies analyzing the shortest routes in GIS and calculating their transportation costs in models. This is beneficial in seeking economic routes which incorporate multiple modes for regions having a spartan infrastructure. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Glycerol, a by-product from transesterification, is well-known as one of the factors inhibiting the reaction. Previous works have mostly shown that the reaction rate slows to a near-steady state and eventually reaches chemical equilibrium. This work aimed to study the inhibiting behavior of glycerol on the transesterification of palm oil. Observation under an LCD digital microscopy showed that glycerol-coated droplets of catalyst-methanol dispersed in the triglyceride phase. This work proposes that glycerol inhibits transesterification by the following mechanism: Droplets of catalyst-methanol disperse into the triglyceride phase; the reaction takes place at an interphase called the reactive zone; methyl ester, the desired product, has low polarity and moves to the triglyceride phase, whereas glycerol, the non-desired product, is more highly polar and accumulates on the droplet surface of catalyst-methanol droplets, inhibiting triglyceride mass transfer and diluting the concentration of the catalyst-methanol. The triglyceride mass transfer coefficient and reaction rate constant were both investigated and expressed as the exponential function. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: To overcome the daunting technical and economic barriers of algal biofuels, we evaluated whether seawater can be a viable medium for economically producing filamentous Spirulina subsalsa as feedstock, using monosodium glutamate residue (MSGR) produced by the glutamate extraction process as an inexpensive nutrient source. Results: Spirulina subsalsa cannot grow in pure seawater, but exhibited faster biomass accumulation in seawater supplemented with MSGR than in freshwater medium (modified Zarrouk medium). Introducing seawater into media ensured this cyanobacterium obtained high lipid productivity (120 mg/L/day) and suffered limited bacterial infections during growth. Moreover, the yields of protein, carotenoids and phytols were also improved in seawater mixed with MSGR. S. subsalsa exhibited high biomass and lipid productivity in bag bioreactors with 5- and 10-L medium, demonstrating the potential of this cultivation method for scaling up. Moreover, seawater can produce more biomass through medium reuse. Reused seawater medium yielded 72% of lipid content compared to pristine medium. The reason that S. subsalsa grew well in seawater with MSGR is its proficient adaptation to salinity, which included elongation and desaturation of fatty acids, accumulation of lysine and methionine, and secretion of sodium. The nutrients provided by MSGR, like organic materials, played an important role in these responses. Conclusion: Spirulina subsalsa has an efficient system to adapt to saline ambiance in seawater. When supplemented with MSGR, seawater is a great potential medium to produce S. subsalsa in large scale as biofuel feedstock. Meanwhile, value-added products can be derived from the ample protein and pigments that can broaden the range of biomass application and improve this biorefinery economics. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - In this work, ionic liquids (ILs) containing the phosphonium cation and four different types of fluorous anions were synthesized and characterized with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, elemental analyser (CHNS) and thermogravimetric techniques. The catalytic transesterification properties of the prepared ILs were investigated through the synthesis of biodiesel from waste cooking oil (WCO). The biodiesel synthesis was performed in two-step processes. Initially, the WCO was esterified with sulphuric acid to reduce its acid value (0.7 mg KOH/g). Later the transesterification reaction was carried out with the prepared ILs, and the process was optimized with respect to IL types, catalyst loading, methanol–oil ratios, temperature, agitation speed and time. Tetrabutylphosphonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([TBP][NTf2]) was identified as a promising catalyst with the highest yield of biodiesel up to 81% at 4.5 wt% of IL loading, 18:1 ratio of methanol:WCO, 10 h of treatment time, 60 °C heating temperature and 600 rpm of agitation speed. The obtained product of biodiesel was characterized and analysed by different techniques, and its physicochemical properties were further determined using the known standard methods of American Society for Testing and Materials and European standards (ASTM and EN). © 2018, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - Based on published literature and typical profiles from the Nankai University source library, a total of 3326 chemical profiles of the main primary sources of ambient particulate matter (PM) across China from 1987 to 2017 are investigated and reviewed to trace the evolution of their main components and identify the main influencing factors concerning their evolution. In general, the source chemical profiles are varied with respect to their sources and are influenced by different sampling methods. The most complicated profiles are likely attributed to coal combustion (CC) and industrial emissions (IE). The profiles of vehicle emissions (VE) are dominated by organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC), and vary due to the changing standards of sulfur and additives in gasoline and diesel as well as the sampling methods used. In addition to the sampling methods used, the profiles of biomass burning (BB) and cooking emissions (CE) are also impacted by the different biofuel categories and cooking types, respectively. The variations of the chemical profiles of different sources, and the homogeneity of the subtype source profiles within the same source category are examined using uncertainty analysis and cluster analysis. As a result, a relatively large variation is found in the source profiles of CC, VE, IE, and BB, indicating that these sources urgently require the establishment of local profiles due to their high uncertainties. The results presented highlight the need for further investigation of more specific markers (e.g., isotopes, organic compounds, and gaseous precursors), in addition to routinely measured components, in order to properly discriminate sources. Although the chemical profiles of the main sources have been previously reported in the literature, it should be noted that some of these chemical profiles are currently out of date and need to be updated immediately. Additionally, in the future, specific focus should be placed on the source profile subtypes, especially with respect to local IE in China. © 2019 Author(s).

AB  - The issue of sustainability assessment of biodiesel production has increasingly gained importance due to the interest of governments in drawing up sovereignty strategies, to diversify their energy matrix and to determine the impact of biofuels production. In this context, this work proposes a system dynamics model to assess biodiesel production in a specific context. A System Dynamics model was developed and applied to assess the sustainability of the conditions in the baseline scenario of biodiesel production in Colombia. Simulation of current biodiesel production showed that a strong support from government policies is required related to the promotion of an increase of the contents of biodiesel in the biodiesel-diesel blend, as well as of the production capacity. Certain dynamics were observed as a result of the modeling, the increase oil palm cultivation, can be related to a lesser rate of displacement of the population, of poverty and of emissions of pollutants affecting air quality (hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and particulate matter). Results also predicted that the increase in oil palm cultivation under baseline scenario could boost inequitable distribution of land ownership and increase greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) in palm oil cultivation, and reduce food security. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Little is known regarding the oxidative potential of biodiesel particulate matter (PM) relative to diesel PM emitted from heavy duty diesel (HDD) nonroad engines generated in real-world occupational settings. The composition of biodiesel and diesel PM can include transition metals, polar, and nonpolar organic species which can increase oxidative potential via production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Elevated ROS can lead to oxidative stress and induce antioxidant defense, inflammation, and toxicity. This study characterized the chemical composition of PM (water soluble organic carbon and elemental metals) collected in a real-world occupational setting. ROS production in a human epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B) treated with biodiesel and diesel PM extracts was compared to oxidative potential measured by an acellular dithiothreitol (DTT) assay. The oxidative potential (DTT consumption rate) of diesel PM was 21% greater than biodiesel PM at the highest treatment concentration (60 μg/mL), yet the ROS generated in vitro were similar between fuel types. Average concentrations of Cu, Cr and Zn were higher in diesel PM compared to biodiesel PM. Additionally, there was a significant correlation between DTT consumption and Cu in diesel PM (r = 0.98), but not B20 PM. There was a strong correlation between WSOC content in diesel PM and ROS generated in vitro (r = 0.83), but no correlation between WSOC content in biodiesel PM and ROS. Taken together, the results indicate the influence of fuel type on the chemical composition and oxidative potential of PM generated by a nonroad HDD engine operated at a recycling center. While acknowledging the potential influence of other species of interest not measured (i.e., quinones), real-world petroleum diesel PM emissions had higher oxidative potential compared to biodiesel PM suggesting that biodiesel use may reduce risk to human health. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This research focuses on the detailed experimental assessment of compression ignition (CI) engine behavior fuelled with Aegle marmelos (AM) seed cake pyrolysis oil blends. The study on effects of engine performance and emission a characteristic was designed using L 25 orthogonal array (OA). These multi-objectives were normalized through gray relational analysis (GRA). Likewise, the principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to assess the weighting values respective to every performance and emission characteristics. The variability induced by using the input process parameters was allocated using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Hence, GRA-coupled PCA were employed to determine the optimal combination of CI engine control factors. The greater combination of engine characteristics levels were selected with F 5 and W 5 . The higher brake thermal efficiency (BTE) have been obtained for F20 fuel as 22.01% at peak engine load, which is 11.43% for diesel. At peak load condition, F20 fuel emits 14.99% lower HC and 18.52% lower CO as compared to diesel fuel. The improved engine performance and emission characters can be attained by setting the optimal engine parameter combination as F20 blend at full engine load condition. The validation experiments show an improved average engine performance of 67.36% and average lower emission of 64.99% with the composite desirability of 0.8458. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Stringent emission regulations and depletion of crude oil are driving researchers toward alternative fuels. In this context, palm oil emerges as a good competitor as it is highly economical compared to other alternative fuels. The current research work centers around the impact of palm oil methyl ester on performance, combustion, and emission characteristics at varying injection timings and exhaust gas recirculation rates. In the first phase of this research work, various blends of palm oil methyl ester with diesel with volume concentrations of 10, 20, and 30% were prepared and tested at different load conditions. Injection timing was then varied for the optimized blend. In the second phase, the impact of exhaust gas blending with fresh charge was studied at optimized injection timing. The test outcomes revealed that 20% mix of palm oil at 27° bTDC with exhaust gas blending of 20% generated higher brake thermal efficiency, higher peak pressure, and less hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide emissions compared to diesel at standard injection timing of 23° bTDC and no blending of exhaust gases with fresh charge. However, progression of injection timing with 20% exhaust gas mixing indicated a slight penalty in smoke discharges. Brake thermal efficiency at advanced injection timing with 20% mix of exhaust gases reduced by 7.7% for diesel and increased by 6.5% for 20% blend of palm oil when compared to standard injection timing of diesel and no blending of exhaust gases. Significant diminishments in oxides of nitrogen (lessened by 6.6%) and hydrocarbons (decreased by 30.43%) have been noted for 20% mix of biodiesel at advanced injection timing with 20% exhaust gas mix contrasted to diesel at standard conditions. Therefore, the present examination prescribes 20% merging of exhaust gases for 20% blend of palm oil with advancement of injection timing for diesel engine applications. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In this work, diethyl ether (DEE) and compressed natural gas (CNG) port fuel injection (PFI) was investigated in direct injection (DI) compression ignition engine to determine the performance, combustion, and emission behaviors. In dual fuel mode, DEE and neat diesel were used as fuel energy, whereas in homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) mode, DEE, and CNG were used as fuel energy. The engine behavior was analyzed for different inlet charge temperatures. Exergy analysis has been carried out for analyzing the various availability shares in the engine. The maximum brake thermal efficiency of the engine increased at peak load from 27.31% in neat diesel to 29.12% for dual fuel mode (D + CNG). Hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions were reduced and oxides of nitrogen increased with the inlet charge heating mode. Maximum exergy efficiency was observed as 57.1% in dual fuel operation. The result of this work proves that CNG in dual and HCCI are effective for engine operation. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The continuous rise in cost of fossil fuels and environmental pollution has attracted research in the area of clean alternative fuels for improving the performance and emission of internal combustion engines. In the present work, methanol and nitromethane were treated as a biofuel and investigations have been made to evaluate the feasibility of replacing diesel with a suitable diesel-methanol-nitromethane blend. For this, experimental investigations were carried out on a VCR diesel engine using diesel-methanol-nitromethane blends to determine the most favorable blending ratio and engine operating parameters for enhancing performance and reduce emissions. The best results of performance and emissions were observed with D-M5-NM2.5 blend (diesel 92.5%, methanol 5%, nitromethane 2.5%) at standard engine parameters. The improvement in engine performance (13% increment in BTE and 19.5% decrement in BSFC) and reduction in emission (smoke 26.47%, NOx 21.66%, and CO 14.28%) was found using D-M5-NM2.5 blend as compared to pure diesel at full load condition; however, HC emission was slightly increased by 10.71%. To find out the best suitable value of CR for D-M5-NM2.5 blend, experiments were further performed on different compression ratios by which higher compression ratio of 19.5 was found better under similar operating conditions. By increasing CR from 18.5 (standard) to 19.5, improvement in engine performance (BTE increased 3.8% and BSFC decreased 3.4%) and reduction in emission (smoke 10%, CO 16.67%, and HC 61.29%) were observed using D-M5-NM2.5 blend; however, NOx was found to be on slightly higher side with tolerable increment of 6.38%. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The isolated microalga Chlorella sorokiniana BENHA721_ABO4 was grown in Bold’s basal medium (BBM) as a control, municipal wastewater (WW), and wastewater enriched with BBM elements (WW+). Cultivation in WW+ showed the highest cell number which represented 25.3 and 47.3% over that grown in WW and BBM, respectively. However, rapid growth in WW+ was accompanied by significant reduction in lipid content. Due to lipid accumulation in WW, it showed the maximum significant lipid productivity of 16.2 mg L−1 day−1. Microalgae cultivation in WW for 10 days showed 74.2, 83.3, and 78.0% removal efficiency for NO3–N, NH3–N and TP, respectively. In addition, growth in WW significantly reduced polyunsaturated fatty acids by 36.0% with respect to BBM in favor of monounsaturated fatty acids. The present results confirmed that C. sorokiniana isolate BENHA721_ABO4 grown in secondary effluent municipal wastewater offers real potential for future application in wastewater treatment and biodiesel production. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The appropriate utilization of waste cooking oil (WCO) can benefit public health and environmental protection. Environmental benefits of biodiesel production from WCO have not been fully investigated, which cannot fully support WCO-related policy decisions and the development of related industries. Taking a typical enterprise producing biodiesel from WCO as an example, this study investigated its environmental impacts throughout the whole life cycle based on the GaBi platform, including the processes of WCO collection, pre-treatment, esterification, and transportation. Results show that the esterification stage has the largest environmental impacts by contributing 53%~96% of the total. Its environmental impacts are mainly attributable to the uses of coal, electricity, and methanol. The sensitivity analysis identifies critical factors influencing the life cycle environmental impacts: the uses of coal, electricity, and methanol and the collection distance of WCO. The life cycle energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of biodiesel production from WCO are 16406 MJ•t-1 and 815 kg CO2 eq•t-1, which are lower than that of fossil-based diesel. Findings of this study can provide scientific foundations for WCO management in China. © 2019, Science Press. All right reserved.

AB  - This work assessed the treatment of wastewater generated from three different industries viz., paper and pulp, biomass gasification and dairy by biodegradation followed by membrane filtration. Batch biodegradation was first carried out using wastewater as the potential substrate for oleaginous Rhodococcus opacus with lipid accumulation intracellular; subsequently, a microfiltration system was applied to recover the bacterial biomass grown as well as for residual chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal from the effluent. The combined process showed excellent results in terms of COD removal from the industrial wastewaters, with the values 56.8%, 46.1% and 68.9% for dairy, paper and pulp and biomass gasification wastewaters, respectively, by biodegradation. These values were further improved to 92.7%, 87.6% and 88.2%, respectively, following the microfiltration step performed by employing a low-cost ceramic membrane. In addition, lipids accumulated by the bacterium were extracted and characterized for biodiesel production potential. Lipid characterization using 1H NMR confirmed the presence of saturated fatty acids. Gas chromatography analysis of the transesterified lipids revealed the presence of methyl palmitate and methyl stearate. In addition, the estimated properties of the transesterified product affirmed its potential for biofuel application. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Second-generation biodiesel manufactured from waste cooking oils (WCO) and inedible animal fats (AF) are one of the alternatives to the first generation (1G) vegetable oil-based biodiesel. In this study, a quality control method is proposed to evaluate methanol content in waste fat methyl esters and is based on near infrared spectroscopy (NIR) combined with multivariate analysis. More specifically, calibration models are constructed using partial least squares regression (PLS) for the prediction of methanol content in rapeseed oil methyl ester (ROME), waste cooking oil methyl ester (WCOME), chicken fat methyl ester (CFME) and pork fat methyl ester (PFME) by Vis-NIR spectrometer. The calibration models are based on the absorbance spectra and computed data from five wavelength regions of 400–2170 nm, 780–2170 nm, 1400–2170 nm, 1400–1600 nm and 1970–2170 nm. For the cases with the highest prediction ability obtained in this study, the coefficient of determination of the model's goodness-of-fit for methanol concentrations range 0–5% (v/v) was R2 &gt; 0.990, and for concentrations 0–1% (v/v) was R2 &gt; 0.994, indicating the spectroscopic approach effectiveness in methanol content detection relevant to the biofuel quality assessment. A pseudo-univariate limits of detection (LODpu) and quantification (LOQpu) as well as ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) were used to confirm the validity and to evaluate the practical applicability of developed models. In addition, the obtained results indicate the possibility of developing a transmission sensor for online monitoring of the production process and the quality of biofuel. © 2018

AB  - On-line chemical characterization of real-world particle emissions from 13 transit buses was performed using a chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS) equipped with a filter inlet for gases and aerosols (FIGAERO). In addition to the fresh emissions the emissions were artificially aged using a potential aerosol mass reactor (Go:PAM). The buses studied were running on different fuel types (diesel, compressed natural gas, and rapeseed methyl ester) and exhaust after-treatment systems (selective catalytic reduction (SCR), exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), and a three-way catalyst). When evaluating emissions from passing exhaust plumes using the FIGAERO ToF-CIMS, two technical features were highlighted from this work, the use of high mass calibrants and the factor enhancement method to be able to filter important compounds from mass spectra including hundreds of species. Here, acetate was used as the reagent ion to enable detection of highly oxygenated species in the exhaust particle emissions with potential high toxicity and/or secondary organic aerosol formation (SOA) potential. The acetate ionization scheme accounted for 4% to 46% of the total emitted particulate mass through identification of 61 species in the spectra. For aged emission the various fuel types provided overlapping species that could explain up to 19% of the aged emissions. This is hypothesized to come from the oxidation of engine lubrication oil, thus a common source for various fuels which was further supported by laboratory measurements. Specific markers from the SCR technology, such as urea oxidation products and further byproducts from hydrolysis were identified and attributed to reactions of isocyanic acid.

AB  - Camelina [Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz] has been identified as a potential oilseed crop for fallow replacement in cropping systems in the semiarid US Great Plains. However, camelina production is limited to the northern Great Plains region. We investigated the effects of three planting dates [mid-March, early-April, and mid-April] and three cultivars (Blaine Creek, Pronghorn, and Shoshone) on spring camelina seed yield and oil quality under non-irrigated conditions in western Kansas. Results showed planting in April increased seed yield by 34% compared with mid-March planting date. Blaine Creek produced greatest seed yield among the cultivars. Planting in mid-March increased oil, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and linolenic acid concentrations compared with April planting dates. Saturated fatty acid (SFA) concentration increased with an April planting date. Heat stress in the growing season reduced seed yield, oil, PUFA, linoleic, and linolenic acid concentrations. However, increase in precipitation amounts improved seed yield, oil, PUFA, and linolenic acid concentrations. Our findings showed early- to mid-April is the best-planting window for optimum spring camelina stands and seed yield in this environment. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Using a WRF-SMOKE-CMAQ modeling framework, we investigate the impacts of smoke from prescribed fires on model performance, regional and loc al air quality, health impacts, and visibility in protected natural environments using three different prescribed fire emission scenarios: 100% fire, no fire, and 30% fire. The 30% fire case reflects a 70% reduction in fire activities due to harvesting of logging residues for use as a feedstock for a potential aviation biofuel supply chain. Overall model performance improves for several performance metrics when fire emissions are included, especially for organic carbon, irrespective of the model goals and criteria used. This effect on model performance is more pronounced for the rural and remote IMPROVE sites for organic carbon and total PM2.5. A reduction in prescribed fire emissions (30% fire case) results in significant improvement in air quality in areas in western Oregon, northern Idaho, and western Montana, where most prescribed fires occur. Prescribed burning contributes to visibility impairment, and a relatively large portion of protected class I areas will benefit from a reduced emission scenario. For the haziest 20% days, prescribed burning is an important source of visibility impairment, and approximately 50% of IMPROVE sites in the model domain show a significant improvement in visibility for the reduced fire case. Using BenMAP, a health impact assessment tool, we show that several hundred additional deaths, several thousand upper and lower respiratory symptom cases, several hundred bronchitis cases, and more than 35,000 workday losses can be attributed to prescribed fires, and these health impacts decrease by 25–30% when a 30% fire emission scenario is considered. Implications: This study assesses the potential regional and local air quality, public health, and visibility impacts from prescribed burning activities, as well as benefits that can be achieved by a potential reduction in emissions for a scenario where biomass is harvested for conversion to biofuel. As prescribed burning activities become more frequent, they can be more detrimental for air quality and health. Forest residue-based biofuel industry can be source of cleaner fuel with co-benefits of improved air quality, reduction in health impacts, and improved visibility. © 2019, © 2019 A&WMA.

AB  - We assess the potential synergies of integrating renewables-based fuels and power production processes in one network, with a strong emphasis on the consideration of operational constraints and time-varying availability of renewable resources. We propose a multiscale mixed-integer linear programming model that combines superstructure-based synthesis and integrated production planning and scheduling. The model is applied to a particular region in Spain, where we analyze the feasibility of a renewables-based process network in terms of meeting given demands for gasoline, diesel, and electricity. The optimal and sometimes counterintuitive designs highlight the complex interactions and help identify bottlenecks in these process networks. Moreover, we solve each case using the multiscale model as well as a commonly used aggregate model; the two models obtain remarkably different solutions. The proposed multiscale model obtains high-quality solutions that stand the test of re-evaluation using a detailed model, whereas the aggregate model proposes network configurations that only satisfy small portions of the demands. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Two inorganic solids have been evaluated as supports of Lipozyme RM IM, a Rhizomucor miehei lipase immobilized on a macroporous anion exchange resin, in order to improve its application as a biocatalyst in the synthesis of biofuels. The experimental conditions have been optimized to get the selective transesterification of sunflower oil, by using a multi-factorial design based on the response surface methodology (RSM). In this way, the effects of several reaction parameters on the selective ethanolysis of triglycerides to produce Ecodiesel, a biodiesel-like biofuel constitute by one mole of monoglyceride (MG) and two moles of fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE), have been evaluated. Thus, it was obtained that a 6:1 oil/ethanol molar ratio, 0.215 g of biocatalyst supported in silica-gel (0.015 g Lipase/0.2 g silica-gel), 50 µL of 10 N NaOH, together with previous optimized reaction parameters, 35 ◦ C reaction temperature and 120 min of reaction time, gave the best results (conversions around 70%; selectivity around 65%; kinematic viscosities about 9.3 mm 2 /s) in the reaction studied. Besides, Lipozyme RM IM, supported on silica-gel, biocatalyst exhibited a very good stability, remaining its activity even after 15 cycles. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The physico-chemical properties of the fuel, such as viscosity, volatility, density, flash point and fire point affect the performance and combustion process. If high viscosity and density biofuel are directly supplied into the engine, complete combustion will not take place in the combustion chamber. Hence different methodologies are employed to get the better performance or atomiza-tion of the fuel. In this experimental study, the effect of injection pressure (IP) on the performance and emission of compression ignition (CI) engine fuelled with rubber seed oil as biodiesel and its blends with pure diesel was evaluated. The engine tests were conducted on constant speed diesel engine fuelled with diesel and various bio-blends of rubber seed oil (RSO) at the proportion of B20. The test results were compared with that of pure diesel as engine test fuel at various injection pressures of 200, 220 and 240 bar. The results show that the brake thermal efficiency has been improved with B20 (20% RSO and 80% pure diesel) at an IP of 240 bar compared to other biofuels at different injection pressures. It was also observed that the emissions, such as carbon monoxide (CO), unburned hydrocarbons (UHC) were considerably reduced and NOx emissions increased when compared to other biofuels at different injection pressures. © 2019 Scientific Publishers.

AB  - We show that the cost of increasing biofuel mandates given a binding ethanol blend wall falls disproportionately on diesel fuel consumers. The extent of the burden on diesel fuel consumers is explained neither by their relatively more inelastic demand nor by blenders seeking to capitalize on the biodiesel tax credit. Relaxing the blend wall constraint by increasing the potential demand for high-ethanol blends is the only effective lever to insulate diesel fuel drivers from the one-sided welfare impacts of rising mandate levels. The independent effects of the nested mandate structure and the joint compliance base under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) generate the link between motor gasoline and diesel fuel markets. Our results highlight the importance of evaluating the incidence of the RFS in a holistic framework taking both ethanol and biodiesel into account. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - This work evaluates the potential of a series hybrid vehicle concept that combines low temperature combustion (LTC)and biofuels as power source. To do this, experimental data from a previous work obtained in a single-cylinder engine running under ethanol-diesel dual-fuel combustion is used. Then, vehicle systems simulations are used to estimate performance and emissions of the LTC hybrid vehicle and compare them versus conventional diesel combustion (CDC). The vehicle selected to perform the simulations is the Opel Vectra, which equips the compression ignition engine used in the experimental tests. The results from the simulations used for the analysis are firstly optimized by combining design of experiments and the Kriging fitting method. The multi-objective optimization allows to determine some characteristics and controls of the hybrid vehicle. The comparison of the estimated performance and emissions of the LTC-hybrid concept versus CDC over the worldwide harmonized light vehicles test cycle (WLTC)and real driving cycle (RDE)revealed clear benefits in terms of energy consumption, CO2 and NOx and soot emissions. In this sense, the hybrid concept enabled a reduction of the final energy consumed of 3% in the RDE cycle and 6.5% in the WLTC as compared to CDC. In terms of engine-out emissions, the CO2 was reduced around 16% versus CDC, and engine-out NOx and soot were reduced below the levels imposed by the Euro 6 regulation. As a penalty, the engine-out HC and CO emissions increased to more than double than CDC. However, based on previous experimental results, it is expected that a conventional diesel oxidation catalyst can reduce the tail-pipe HC and CO levels below the Euro 6 limits. © 2019

AB  - Orbignya speciosa (babassu) is an important palm tree in Brazil whose fixed almond oil is used in popular medicine and especially in food, in addition to being a research target for the manufacture of biofuels. The aim of this study was to evaluate the fixed almond oil physicochemical characterization and its antibacterial activity in isolation and in association with aminoglycosides against standard and multidrug-resistant bacteria. Analyses such as water content, pH, acidity, peroxide index, relative density, and refractive index indicate the stability and chemical quality of the oil. In the oil’s GC/MS chemical composition analysis, a high saturated fatty acid (76.90%) content was observed. Lauric acid (56.28%) and oleic acid (23.10%) were the major oil components. In the antibacterial test, a more significant oil activity was observed against K. pneumoniae KP-ATCC 10031 (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 406.37 _g/mL) and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 (MIC = 812.75 _g/mL), but for the other strains—including standard and multi-resistant strains—the oil presented an MIC _ 1024 _g/mL. Furthermore, a synergistic effect was observed when the oil was associated with amikacin and gentamicin against S. aureus (SA-10) and an antagonistic effect was observed with amikacin against Escherichia coli. Data indicate the O. speciosa oil as a valuable nutritional source of lauric, oleic, and myristic fatty acids with an ability to modulate aminoglycoside activity. © 2019, MDPI AG.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biofuels are the most promising sustainable fuels that can be added to the crude oil pool to refill the dwindling fossil resources. In this work, we tested a Raney-Ni catalyst for the hydrogenation of four bio-oil model compounds and their binary mixtures to assess their reactivity under mild conditions suitable for bio-oil stabilization preceding green diesel production from lingo cellulosic biomass. The hydrogenation experiments were performed at ambient hydrogen pressure at temperatures in the range 30-70 °C. Raney-Ni was found to hydrogenate all investigated model compounds efficiently; both carbonyl groups and double bonds were saturated. In addition, it was also active in the demethoxylation of guaiacol. When studying the binary mixtures, furfuryl alcohol was found to significantly inhibit the hydrogenation of the other model compounds (guaiacol and methyl isobutyl ketone) due to their very strong adsorption. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biofuels are the most promising sustainable fuels that can be added to the crude oil pool to refill the dwindling fossil resources. In this work, we tested a Raney-Ni catalyst for the hydrogenation of four bio-oil model compounds and their binary mixtures to assess their reactivity under mild conditions suitable for bio-oil stabilization preceding green diesel production from lingo cellulosic biomass. The hydrogenation experiments were performed at ambient hydrogen pressure at temperatures in the range 30-70 °C. Raney-Ni was found to hydrogenate all investigated model compounds efficiently; both carbonyl groups and double bonds were saturated. In addition, it was also active in the demethoxylation of guaiacol. When studying the binary mixtures, furfuryl alcohol was found to significantly inhibit the hydrogenation of the other model compounds (guaiacol and methyl isobutyl ketone) due to their very strong adsorption. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The broad expanse of the urban metropolitan area of São Paulo (MASP) has made buses, the predominant public transport mode for commuters in the city. In 2016, the bus fleet in the MASP reached 56,354 buses and it was responsible for more than 12 million daily trips. Here, we evaluate for the first time, the emission profile of gaseous and particulate pollutants from buses running on 7% biodiesel + 93% petroleum diesel and their spatial distribution in the MASP. This novel study, based on four bus terminal experiments, provides an extensive analysis of atmospheric pollutants of interest to public health and climate changes, such as CO2, CO, NOx, VOCs, PM10, PM2.5 and their constituents (black carbon (BC) and elements). Our results suggest that the renovation of the bus fleet from Euro II to Euro V and the incorporation of electric buses had a noticeable impact (by a factor of up to three) on the CO2 emissions and caused a decrease in NO emissions, by a factor of four to five. In addition, a comparison with previous Brazilian studies, shows that the newer bus fleet in the MASP emits fewer particles. Emissions from the public transport sector have implications for public health and air quality, not only by introducing reactive pollutants into the atmosphere but also by exposing the commuters to harmful concentrations. Our findings make a relevant contribution to the understanding of emissions from diesel-powered buses and about the impact of these new vehicular technologies on the air quality in the MASP. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The transformation of sunflower oil (SO) and waste cooking oil (WCO) into green diesel over co-precipitated nickel–zirconia catalysts was studied. Two series of catalysts were prepared. The first series included catalysts with various Ni loadings prepared using zirconium oxy-chloride, whereas the second series included catalysts with 60–80 wt % Ni loading prepared using zirconium oxy-nitrate as zirconium source. The catalysts were characterized and evaluated in the transformation of SO into green diesel. The best catalysts were also evaluated for green diesel production using waste cooking oil. The catalysts performance for green diesel production is mainly governed by the Ni surface exposed, their acidity, and the reducibility of the ZrO2. These characteristics depend on the preparation method and the Zr salt used. The presence of chlorine in the catalysts drawn from the zirconium oxy-chloride results to catalysts with relatively low Ni surface, high acidity and hardly reduced ZrO2 phase. These characteristics lead to relatively low activity for green diesel production, whereas they favor high yields of wax esters. Ni-ZrO2 catalysts with Ni loading in the range 60–80 wt %, prepared by urea hydrothermal co-precipitation method using zirconium oxy-nitrate as ZrO2 precursor salt exhibited higher Ni surface, moderate acidity, and higher reducibility of ZrO2 phase. The latter catalysts were proved to be very promising for green diesel production. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The utilization of various solid biofuels in combustion plants often requires the application of secondary emission reduction measures in order to meet legal requirements. Since common multi-stage exhaust cleaning methods are too expensive for the application in decentral biomass combustion, new approaches have to be investigated which can be applied economically in small- and medium-sized plants. The combined removal of particulate and gaseous emissions in one unit can save investment and operation costs. In this context, a method for simultaneous reduction of particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen oxides (NOX) was developed and tested. The investigations focused on the alignment of the system components and the determination of optimal operating parameters for use in decentralized biomass furnaces. Experiments with wood chips and different non-woody biomass pellets at a 120-kW pilot plant showed significant reduction of PM and NOX. There is still a need for optimization with regard to the NH3 slip and the degree of particle separation. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Biofuels are sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels. However, they must comply with energy efficiency requirements and contribute to environmental protection. This study was focused on elemental composition (carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur and chlorine) of different plants' components (stems, branches, twigs and leaves) from pyrolysed (charcoal) and non-pyrolysed samples of five semi-arid trees: Acacia berlandieri, A. wrightii, Ebenopsis ebano, Havardia pallens and Helietta parvifolia. Carbon fluctuated from 80.77% to 89.30% in charcoal and 44.99% to 49.70% in non-pyrolysed biomass, and hydrogen ranged from 2.38% to 2.69% in charcoal and 5.89% to 6.62% in non-pyrolysed biomass. Nitrogen accounted for 0.39%-0.65% (branches) and 0.32%-0.64% (stems) in charcoal, and the ranges for non-pyrolyzed material were 2.33-4.00% (leaves), 1.06%-1.76% (twigs), 0.21%-0.52% (branches) and 0.15%-0.28% (stems). Considerably higher concentrations of sulphur compared to chlorine were found, with increasing values for both elements from the base of trees to the leaves. Non-pyrolysed samples were characterized by 68.05 mg/kg-769.16 mg/kg (stems), 118.02 mg/kg-791.68 mg/kg (branches), 225.11 mg/kg-1742.25 mg/kg (twigs) and 374.73 mg/kg-6811.52 mg/kg (leaves) for sulphur, and 117.86 mg/kg-528.08 mg/kg (stems), 109.18 mg/kg-464.15 mg/kg (branches), 905.47 mg/kg-4205.19 mg/kg (twigs) and 2799.68 mg/kg-5072.76 mg/kg (leaves) for chlorine. In charcoal, the concentration ranges for sulphur were 47.54 mg/kg-376.95 mg/kg (branches) and 42.73-292.20 mg/kg (stems) and 139.34 mg/kg-419.68 mg/kg (branches) and 177.39 mg/kg-479.16 (stems) for chlorine. The study has shown that pyrolysis increased the amount of carbon and decreased the amount of hydrogen. Coincidentally, the amount of nitrogen, chlorine and sulphur could be decreased significantly by pyrolysis which means an improvement of the fuel considering the flue gas emissions. Besides the influence of the type of combustion plant and the influence of the source of biofuel, the treatment has a significant influence on the amount and composition of flue gases emitted in the combustion. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Supplementation of carbon is critical for high productivity cultivation of most microalgae. Moreover, using microalgae for atmospheric CO 2 mitigation to combat climate change is promising as waste sources and atmospheric CO 2 can be utilized to produce useful products. The challenge is developing technologies, processes, and strategies that utilize carbon efficiently such that the overall system is sustainable. Through engineering system modeling combined with techno-economic and life-cycle assessments, this study examined the implications of various delivery methods of carbon to a production-scale algal biorefinery. Five primary carbon sources were considered: atmospheric CO 2 ; CO 2 from direct chemical or power plant waste emissions; CO 2 that has been concentrated from waste sources and compressed; inorganic carbon in the form of hydrogen carbonate; and organic carbon in the form of cellulosic sugars derived from corn stover. Each source was evaluated assuming co-location as well as pipeline transportation up to 100 km. Sustainability results indicate that economics are more prohibitive than energy and emissions. Of the scenarios evaluated, only two met both the economic and environmental criteria of contributing less than 0.50 US-$ GGE -1 and 20 g CO 2-eq MJ -1 to the overall system, respectively: uncompressed, pure sources of gaseous CO 2 with pipeline transportation of 40 km or less; and compressed, supercritical CO 2 from pure sources for pipeline transportation up to 100 km. A first order scalability assessment of algal biofuels based on these results shows carbon to be a limiting nutrient in an algal biorefinery with a total US production capability of 360 million gallons of fuel per year. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The amphyphylic triazoanilines recently synthesized 1-(4-(3-aminophenyl)-1H-1,2,3- triazole-1-yl)-3-(3-pentadecylphenoxy)propan-2-ol (1) and 1-(4-(4-aminophenyl)-1H- 1,2,3-triazole-1-yl)-3-(3-pentadecylphenoxy)propan-2-ol (2), synthesized from cardanol and glycerol, have photophysical properties which allow their use in the development of fluorescent biomarkers with applicability in the biodiesel quality control. Based on this, the present research evaluated the toxic effects of both compounds in different biological models through the investigation of survival and mortality percentages as a measure of acute toxicity on Daphnia similis and Oreochromis niloticus, larvicidal assay against Aedes aegypti, and cytotoxic activity on mammary cells. Results demonstrate that these triazoanilines 1 and 2 have shown low acute toxicity to the biological models investigated in this study up to the following concentrations: 4.0 mg L-1 (D. similis), 4.0 mg L-1 (A. aegypti larvae), 1.0 mg L-1 (O. niloticus), and 1.0 mg mL-1 (mammary cells). This fact suggests the potential for safe use of compounds 1 and 2 as fluorescent markers for the monitoring of biodiesel quality, even in the case of environmental exposure. Besides all of that, the reuse of cardanol and glycerol, both industrial wastes, favors the maintenance of environmental health and is in agreement with the assumptions of green chemistry. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Vegetable oils are found suitable alternate of diesel fuel as per the results of short-run studies. Long-run studies with vegetable oil as a fuel pointed out the problems related to wear and maintenance of the engine. A single cylinder, variable compression ratio diesel engine was tested for 512 h (32 cycles of 16 h per day) to investigate longevity implications of fueling Thumba vegetable oil. Results of the study revealed that a very little damage was observed over the running surface of the cylinder liner, piston rings, valves, and valve seats. Wear in the piston outer diameter was observed to be 13 to 30 microns. Cylinder wear was about 80 microns. The closed gap in the oil piston ring increased up to 200 microns. Heavy carbon deposition was found on different internal parts of the engine, which indicates poor combustion of fuel. Amount of copper (66 mg/kg) and silicon (112 mg/kg) dissolved in the lubricating oil was found more than permissible limits (Cu 50 mg/kg, Si 25 mg/kg), after 450-h engine test run. But all the dissolve materials remain in allowable limits when the durability test conducted with diesel. Smoke, CO, HC, and NO X emissions were found to increase initially then decrease in the further engine running hours. But these emissions were found inferior to the engine emissions fueled with diesel in all the running hours. CO2 emissions were found superior throughout the test with the preheated T20 Thumba oil blend than diesel. The maximum reduction in the viscosity of the lubricating oil, during endurance testing, was found 60 centipoises but it was found 25 centipoises when the test conducted with diesel. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Nonrenewable fossil fuels show increased demand and with fossil fuels at a rapid depleting stage, there seems to be an increase in requirement for alternative fuels too. Biofuels and blended fossil fuels are one of a kind. Nonedible jatropha (Jatropha curcas) oil-based methyl ester was produced and mixed with ethanol and blended with conventional diesel in various compositions. Jatropha biodiesel is used because of its great blending capacity with diesel. Sodium hydroxide is used as a catalyst which allows miscibility between ethanol and diesel. In present epoch, the paucity of fossil fuels and its adverse impact have driven researchers to focus on alternative fuels. Biodiesel is one of the most favorable and promising alternatives in the application of automobiles, boilers, gas turbines, etc. This study targets at finding the engine performance and emission characteristics under various load conditions on Kirloskar single-cylinder VCR research engine by blending both jatropha biodiesel and ethanol with base diesel at various compositions. Both jatropha biodiesel and ethanol have high calorific value which is a most important factor for engine power production. The performance analysis showed that the biodiesel blend of 98% diesel with 1.5% jatropha biodiesel and 0.5% (D98J1.5E0.5) of ethanol had a significant improvement in the engine performance than the conventional diesel. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Over the past years, there were dramatic improvements in identifying and assessing various feedstocks for the production of biodiesel fuels. To promote a particular feedstock as a renewable source of energy, it is important to analyze their energy, economic, and engine performance characteristics. The current work attempts to evaluate the net energy and economic indices for both fossil diesel and coconut-blended diesel (B20) considering the diesel consumption by the Indian railways. Further, we present the experimental results of a multi-cylinder diesel engine operated with neat coconut biodiesel (B100) and fossil diesel at various load and speed conditions. The engine experiments reveal that the coconut biodiesel exhibits leaner combustion and shorter ignition delay than fossil diesel. Lower amount of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, and smoke emission is observed in the case of coconut biodiesel, with higher levels of nitric oxide (14%) and fuel consumption than diesel. The coefficient of variation in indicated mean effective pressure is within the range of better driveability zone for both the fuels at all test conditions. Overall the engine performance, emission and combustion results with neat coconut biodiesel are favorable with a penalty in NO emission at high load conditions. The techno-economical study highlights higher production cost per liter of B20 than the cost of fossil diesel. However, the net energy ratio (NER) for B20 is 1.021, favoring higher output than diesel and thus lowers the dependency on crude oil. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - A vegetable oil–fueled diesel engine operation is characterized by low brake thermal efficiency and relatively high smoke emission. Conversion of vegetable oil to biodiesel results in slight improvement in efficiency and smoke emission, but the values are not comparable with diesel. In this work, a single-cylinder diesel engine’s performance is evaluated by inducting hydrogen in small quantities in the intake manifold along with Deccan hemp oil (DHO) and its methyl ester (DHOME) as the pilot fuel. The tests were conducted at part-load and full-load conditions at an engine speed of 1500 rpm. Results indicate an increase in brake thermal efficiency from 29.7 to 32.6% and from 27.3 to 29.6% at full load with hydrogen-induced DHOME and DHO engine operation. Unburned-hydrocarbon emissions, carbon monoxide emission, and smoke emission reduced for both the fuels. However, NOx levels increased for the two fuels because hydrogen induction causes high combustion rates and high temperature in the combustion chamber. Hydrogen induction leads to high premixed combustion resulting in high peak pressures. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Catalytic hydropyrolysis (CHP) of scrap tire was investigated for production of gasoline fuel. Effects of CHP process variables such as catalysts type ((activated carbon, AC), Ir/C, Rh/C, Pt/C, Ru/C, and Pd/C), temperature (200–450 °C), time (30–120 min), catalyst loading (0–40 wt%), and hydrogen pressure (0.1–12 MPa) on the CHP products distribution and properties of the hydropyrolysis oil (HPO) were examined. Ru/C was identified as the most suitable catalyst in terms of the HPO quality and the catalytic effect predominantly came from the noble metal. Temperature was the most influential factor affecting the yield and quality of the HPO and followed by the order of catalyst loading &gt; H 2 pressure &gt; time. Higher temperature, time, and catalyst loading would decrease the yield of HPO and increase the yield of gaseous product whereas contrary results were observed with increasing the H 2 pressure. With added noble metals, the hydrodenitrogenation, hydroSization, and hydrodeoxygenation reactions of the HPO were promoted and greatly lowered N, O, and S contents of the HPO with increasing the temperature, time, catalyst loading, and H 2 pressure. The lowest N, O, and S contents of 0.02, 0.41 and 0.41 wt% of HPO were achieved at 430 °C, 60 min, 10 wt% Ru/C, and 12 MPa H 2 . The higher-heating value of the HPOs varied between 44 and 46 MJ/kg depending on the reaction conditions. More than half of the energy of the ST was converted into the HPO. The HPO mainly consisted of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons one to five benzene derivatives. The distillate fraction between 35 and 250 °C of the HPO is more than 80 wt%. Thus, we view that CHP is an alternative way to produce high quality hydro-carbon fuel from scrap tire. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microalgal lipids have a huge potential in several applications such as biofuels, food and feed. However, enzymatic lipolytic reactions during wet storage cause the formation of substantial amounts of free fatty acids (FFA), which give several problems for these applications. In this study, a full factorial (32) design with varying time and temperature was used to optimize a heat treatment, that inactivates lipolytic enzymes in the wet paste of T-Isochrysis lutea. Therefore, the FFA and lipid content were evaluated at three time points (0, 3 and 7 days) during wet storage at 4 °C. A treatment of at least 8 min at 80 °C was found to inactivate the lipolytic enzymes. A second experiment elucidated that this optimal treatment had no negative impact on fatty acid composition, peroxide value, phenolic content or carotenoid content. A short heat treatment, thus, enables wet storage of microalgal paste to several days at 4 °C. © 2018

AB  - As microalgae becomes a feedstock of interest for biofuels production, technologies have advanced to provide a variety of methods for cultivation and processing. This study explores the economic viability and environmental impact of processing high productivity, low lipid, high ash content algae into biofuels using two different production pathways. The two processing pathways explored are, 1) Biochemical processing via protein and carbohydrate fermentation to produce fusel alcohol products, followed by hydrothermal liquefaction to produce a biocrude, and 2) Thermal-chemical processing via whole algal hydrothermal liquefaction and used as a baseline for the biochemical process. For a feedstock, this study considered algae harvested from an algal turf scrubber, which represents a robust high productivity system, at the expense of a producing a biomass with lower lipid content and higher ash compared to conventional algae production systems. Techno-economic results show the minimum fuel selling price of $12.85 and $10.41 GGE−1 for the biochemical and thermal-chemical pathways, respectively. Life cycle assessments shows a global warming potential of 111.2 g and − 2 g CO2eq MJ fuel−1 for the biochemical and thermal-chemical pathways, respectively. Sensitivity analysis on techno-economic model inputs identifies strategic areas for further research in an effort to move towards an economically viable process. Improvements in the system based on sensitivity and techno-economic analysis results show a pathway to $3.85 GGE−1. Discussion focuses on potentials for ash removal, decrease of biomass cost and potential for higher value products. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Commercial production of algal biofuels is currently limited by high capital costs, particularly costs of synthetic pond liners that minimize seepage of cultivation fluids, salts, and nutrients into the subsurface beneath outdoor algae cultivation facilities. Even some profitable nutraceutical companies bear the high costs of pond liners. However, studies of animal waste holding ponds and aquaculture facilities have shown that underlying soils can effectively “self-seal” potentially eliminating the need for plastic liners. Here, we explored the potential for self-sealing with algae to provide an alternative to synthetic pond liners in unlined algae cultivation ponds. Laboratory-scale soil column experiments were used to investigate soil clogging by algae, a topic rarely discussed in the literature. Columns composed of fine sand, loamy sand, and loam soil displayed reductions in saturated hydraulic conductivity of the entire soil column of up to two orders of magnitude in response to infiltration by the alga Scenedesmus dimorphus suspended in algal culture nutrient solution at a density of 5 × 108 cells L−1. Scanning electron microscope imaging showed a dense algal layer on the surface of each soil column, thickly coating mineral grains with algal material and filling pore spaces. The algal coating was absent in samples at &gt;3 cm depth in the soil columns, and measurements of chlorophyll content also confirmed that algal cells were mostly confined to the soil surface. In this study, the application of an algal suspension contributed significantly to soil sealing. This new application of biological sealing technology should be studied further to determine its utility and durability as an alternative to plastic liners, perhaps in conjunction with soil compaction to achieve hydraulic conductivities beneath algal production ponds that are protective of groundwater quality. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In many countries, the replacement of internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) with battery electric vehicles (BEVs) offers an opportunity to reduce CO2 equivalent (CO2eq) emissions in traffic. BEVs have significantly greater energy conversion efficiency from energy storage to wheel (tank-to-wheel [TTW]) and zero tailpipe emissions; these features are in stark contrast to the environmental burdens posed by vehicle production and electricity generation (well-to-tank [WTT]). Since CO2eq emissions from vehicle use of BEVs account for the majority of the entire life cycle emissions, it is important to closely examine the CO2eq intensity of electricity generation, which varies based on the sources of energy in the electricity mix of each country and time of day. This paper compares the environmental impact of diesel and electric buses in the city of Aachen throughout their life cycles and analyzes the effects of electricity generation with reference to variation in charging time. Based on recorded driving profiles, the vehicle dynamics of the longitudinal motion are simulated, and the energy demand as a function of the altitude profile and ambient temperature is calculated. The calculation of the quarter-hourly CO2eq intensity is combined with the vehicle life cycle model in order to examine the effects of electricity generation on BEV life cycle emissions. To analyze the correlation between charging time and BEV environmental impact, different charging scenarios are defined, and CO2eq savings from replacing ICEVs with BEVs are estimated. Scenario analyses are conducted over both short- and long-term time scales to predict the future environmental and economic benefits and costs of BEVs compared to ICEVs. The results demonstrate a significant dependency of BEV environmental impact on charging time, which varies by time of day and season. At night, the contribution of renewable energies to the electricity mix is low, and the variation in CO2eq intensity is limited; therefore, the environmental impact of charging time is lower compared to charging at noon. The larger CO2eq emissions of BEV production are compensated for all scenarios within the first year of operation. However, if BEVs are charged with electricity generated exclusively by lignite-fired power plants, more CO2eq emissions are released over their lifetimes compared to ICEVs; this scenario also holds when ICEVs are fueled with biodiesel. Overall, the positive environmental balance of BEVs is not based on a low CO2eq intensity, but on the greater energy conversion efficiency and the possibility of recuperating braking energy. These properties are particularly advantageous in urban traffic. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The production of biodiesel using alternative feedstocks and green technologies has attracted increasing interest of researchers worldwide. In this study, the production of biodiesel through microwave-assisted esterification of Palm Fatty Acid Distillate (PFAD) was studied experimentally as well by means of a simulation. The complex permittivities of PFAD and biodiesel were experimentally measured for the temperature range 25–120 °C. At the microwave frequency of 2.45 GHz, the dielectric properties of PFAD and its biodiesel were found to be 2.78–0.17j and 3.26–0.21j respectively. An optimal biodiesel yield (91.88%) was reported at 15 min of 300 W microwave irradiation, for a 1:9 PFAD to methanol ratio catalysed by sulfuric acid. The study revealed that microwave-assisted PFAD esterification has a second order reaction kinetics, with a frequency factor of 3.65 × 10−8 M−1 s−1 and an activation energy of −36 kJ. For the first time, a three-dimensional multi-physics model was developed for the microwave-assisted PFAD esterification process in this study. The simulated model included the effects of electromagnetic propagation, heat transfer, fluid flow, and chemical species conservation. The numerical predictions were found to be in good agreement with the experimental results. The study also found that the fluid flow and vaporisation of methanol and water are important for good model prediction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study investigates opportunities to improve the cost competitiveness of the palm oil biodiesel industry in Indonesia. It compares costs and revenues of standalone conventional palm oil and biodiesel production with an integrated system that includes utilisation of biomass residues. Economic metrics, viz. net income, NPV, IRR, payback period and biodiesel breakeven price are evaluated. Sensitivity analyses are carried out to verify how parameter changes affect net income. The results show that the integrated concept with upgraded CPO and biodiesel processing plant (Biorefinery), which simultaneously produces biodiesel, electricity, heat and biofertiliser, can obtain an additional income of 14 USD/t-FFB compared to the Conventional System. The biorefinery system helps to reduce dependency on government subsidy for biodiesel production, and lowers the industry vulnerability to fluctuation of fossil diesel prices. The shift to modern facilities with value chain integration provides a pathway to enhance the share of renewable energy in Indonesia through increased biodiesel production and electricity generation from palm biomass residues. It may also promote resource efficiency and climate change mitigation through reduced emissions from untreated residues and fossil energy carriers. The analysis enhances understanding about potential gains and consequences of more stringent policy implementation in the country. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction is a promising technology to convert wet biomass into bio-oil with high calorific value and without drying process. To evaluate the potential application of liquefaction bio-oil in industry, the present study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis on the properties of liquefaction bio-oil derived from food waste. The food waste is pretreated with K2CO3 at 100 °C for 1 h, followed by liquefaction in a semi-pilot reactor at 320 °C for 30 min. The higher heating value of produced bio-oil is 34.79 MJ kg−1, accounting for 53% increase when compared to the feedstock (22.74 MJ kg−1). The ignition and burnout temperatures of the bio-oil are lower than other liquefaction bio-oils, reflecting its higher reactivity and combustibility. Meanwhile, the bio-oil has a higher oxidation onset temperature than pyrolysis bio-oils, showing its higher thermal stability. The independent parallel reaction model in association with the particle swarm optimization indicates that the pyrolysis kinetics of the bio-oil can be approximated by four groups. The component analysis further reveals two important groups of fatty acids and amides in the bio-oil, stemming from the conversion of carbohydrate and protein in the food waste. The comprehensive analysis shows that the liquefaction bio-oil from food waste, characterized by higher energy density and better combustibility, is a potential substitute to the fossil fuels. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An algae polyculture (discovered in oil and gas produced water (PW) originating from a production facility in the Permian Basin of southwestern New Mexico) was composed primarily of Cyanobacterium aponinum, Parachlorella kessleri, with the remaining populations consisting of several species of halotolerant bacteria. The polyculture was tested in PW based media at a variety of different salinities and initial nutrient concentrations to determine the effects of these environmental conditions upon growth and lipid production. The polyculture exhibited growth rates of 46–51 mg ash free dry weight (AFDW)/L/D in PW over a salinity range from 15 to 60 g total dissolved solids (TDS)/L in PW containing nitrate as a nitrogen source. Growth was reduced at higher salinity. Biomass productivity in 60 g TDS/L PW was higher with ammonium as the nitrogen source (47.2–57 mg AFDW/L/D) than nitrate, with the highest growth observed using initial concentrations of 13 mg NH4-N and 1.7 PO4-P/L (single day growth of 99 mg AFDW/L/D). Of the conditions tested lipid productivity was greatest (around 12 mg lipids/L/D) at a salinity of 60 g TDS/L after phosphorus depletion (ammonium still present), and the maximum lipid content (48% of AFDW) after ammonium depletion (phosphate still present). Higher salinity, initial ammonium, and phosphate levels enriched for P. kessleri over C. aponinum, which also resulted in increased lipid content and productivity. Conversion of lipids to fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) created a profile dominated by palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0) acid and would produce a usable biodiesel. The results indicated that a mixed culture of C. aponinum, P. kessleri, and other micro fauna is a potential candidate for cultivation in brackish to hypersaline PW based media for the production of biomass and/or biofuels. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel is a non-toxic and renewable fuel produced by a transesterification reaction between alcohol and vegetable oil. The objective of this paper is to optimize the ultrasound-assisted production of biodiesel. The central composite design method was used to optimize the transesterification reaction conditions of biodiesel production from peanut oil. The independent variables investigated in the course of the experiment include the catalyst concentration, the reaction time, and the ultrasonic amplitude. The reaction was done by employing ultrasound under set conditions of atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature. A statistical model predicted the optimum conversion yield of peanut biodiesel to be 100.00% under the following optimum experimental conditions: ultrasonic amplitude equals 69.7%, catalyst concentration equals 0.88% weight percent catalyst, and reaction time of 39.38 s. Also, such conditions led to obtaining the linear equation for predicting the conversion yield of biodiesel production. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - For many agricultural commodity sectors, efforts to meet international obligations regarding emissions reduction are increasing. The Australian cotton industry has already made advances in this regard and the high yields associated with Australian cotton production dramatically minimise greenhouse gas emissions intensity. However, certainty about the quantum of greenhouse gas emissions and the relative contribution of different components of the emissions profile is somewhat unclear; and opportunities for farm-level practice change have not been fully explored. The objectives of this paper were to, (a) build a robust greenhouse gas emissions profile for the product-chain of Australian cotton fibre (lint) grown in northwest New South Wales, (b) using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), compare the relative contributions of the different industries involved in the product-chain of cotton fibre (e.g. fertiliser producers, cotton farmers, cotton ginning plants) and (c) assess the effects of an array of on-farm mitigation options. Testing the various management options provides information for growers and policy-makers about the relative emissions reduction benefits possible. Additionally, we compared results of previous Australian cotton production studies using similar assumptions and extrapolated the emissions profile to a national scale, with the intention of informing commodity and carbon markets. The foreground data for the study were for the three production seasons from 2011-2012 to 2013–2014 in northwest New South Wales, with a functional unit of one tonne of cotton lint at port. We also drew upon published data, survey data, scientific literature and Australian and international databases. To ensure consistency between our approach and that applied to meet international emissions reporting obligations, we applied emissions formulae and factors from the Australian National Inventory Report, except where more specific published data were available. We assumed that 96% of production was from irrigated systems, with 85% of irrigation water pumped by diesel-powered irrigation pumps and a median irrigated yield of 10.3 bales per ha. We tested the sensitivity of the resulting emissions profile to a wide array of enterprise assumptions and calculation variables. The climate change impact of cotton lint on a cradle-to-port basis was 1601 kg CO2e per tonne of cotton lint. The ‘hot-spots’ within the emissions profile included the production and use of synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilisers (46% of emissions), the production and use of electricity and diesel used for irrigation (10%) and the production and use of diesel for farm machinery (9%). Farm level management options with potential to minimise life cycle GHG emissions were: reducing N fertiliser rate from a commercial rate of 255 kg N/ha to 240 kg N/ha or 180 kg N/ha (2.6% and 13.2% emissions reduction); use of controlled-release and stabilised N fertilisers (5.9% reduction), changing from diesel to solar-powered irrigation pumps (8.1% reduction), changing from diesel to biofuel-powered farm machinery (3.4% reduction), changing from continuous cotton to a cotton-legume crop rotation (3.9% reduction) and use of N fertigation (2.1% reduction). Whilst we focused on farm-level mitigation strategies, these changes were placed in the context of the cradle-to-gate system, to account for associated changes in pre-farm and post-farm emissions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper concerns about bio fuel production from renewable biomass resource and its characteristics in diesel engines. In this research work, Free Fatty Acid Oils (FFAO) from oil refineries was considered as biomass renewable resource for the production of biodiesel. These free fatty acid oil are one of the waste by product in edible oil extraction refineries and its potential energy can be easily converted into useful biodiesel in bio fuel sector by the process of transesterification. Due to ethanol catalyst used in transesterification process, Ethyl esters of free fatty acid oils (EEFFAO) were extracted from FFAO. These EEFFAO were blended with diesel in different proportions (20, 40, 60, 80 and pure EEFFAO) to indentify the maximum possibility to use an biodiesel in diesel engines. From the results, possibilities of biofuel from free fatty acid oil can be replaced at 20 percentage in existing fossil fuel depletion. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Triacylglycerols (TAGs) produced by microalgae are a promising biofuel resource, but low productivity is still a problem for practical production. Understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms of TAG production is essential to improve productivity, which remains mostly in a primitive stage. Recently, a nuclear gene encoding a chloroplast inner membrane protein, AtFAX1, which is involved in the export of fatty acids (FAs) from the chloroplast, was identified and analyzed in Arabidopsis thaliana. In this study, we identified and analyzed a nuclear-encoded homolog of AtFAX1, named CmFAX1, from the unicellular red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae. CmFAX1 was localized around the chloroplast envelope membrane in C. merolae, and heterologous expression in budding yeast suggested a role in FA traffic through membranes. Overexpression of CmFAX1 in C. merolae cells resulted in a 0.4-fold decrease in intracellular free FAs and a 2.4-fold increase in intracellular TAGs under normal growth conditions, suggesting that export of the free FAs produced in the chloroplast was enhanced and they were consumed for TAG synthesis in the cytosol. The accumulated TAGs in the CmFAX1 overexpression strain included short chain FAs, 14:0 and 14:1, which were not observed in the TAGs of the control strain and are suitable for biojet/biodiesel production because of their low cloud points. Overproduction of CmFAX1 resulted in higher cell yields after exponential growth phase culture. This was probably because of decreased photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a) and increased light permeability into the highly dense cell culture, which are beneficial characteristics for increased biomass production. These results indicate that CmFAX1 could be a useful target protein for improvement of algal biofuel production. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Liquid hydrocarbon biofuels obtained from the catalytic cracking of animal fats and plant oils have become attractive because of their possible environmental benefits, and the current concerns over the depletion of fossil-fuel sources. In this work, five different metal-oxide (ZnO, La 2 O 3 , CeO 2 , NiO and MgO) modified SBA-15 (MeO-SBA-15) samples were prepared by a simple one-pot synthesis method and were used in the catalytic cracking of waste cooking oils. The synthesized catalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction, N 2 physisorption, transmission electron microscopy and Fourier-transform infrared techniques, and their catalytic performances were investigated in detail in the cracking of waste cooking oils. To obtain high-quality biofuel, all the pyrolysis products were separated into two compounds by distillation: (a) liquid hydrocarbon biofuels including gasoline and diesel fractions (distillation temperature ≤ 350 °C); (b) heavy oils (distillation temperature &gt;350 °C). The results indicated that the mesostructure of the SBA-15 was well preserved after metal oxide modification, and the MeO-SBA-15 catalysts improved the hydrocarbon biofuels yield and decreased the heavy oil yield. Among the catalysts, the ZnO-SBA-15 showed an excellent catalytic performance and produced the highest biofuel yield (37.3%) and the lowest yield of heavy oils (39.9%). The liquid hydrocarbon biofuels obtained using the ZnO-SBA-15 catalyst had a similar chemical composition to the diesel-based fuels and showed a lower density, lower viscosity and higher heating values than raw waste cooking oils. These results indicated that ZnO-SBA-15 can promote the chemical reactions, such as deoxygenation and decarbonylation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biomass has the specific characteristic of being included in a short regeneration cycle that minimizes its ecological impact and should give it a preferential role in the energy transition. The scale up in the deployment of bioenergy requires an objective approach to processes. It is necessary to identify, according to a defined and available biomass, the most appropriate processes and products to extend their deployment This requires deep process analysis to identify achievable optimizations and opportunities of improvement. In order to provide criteria to identify the upper theoretical limits of biomass conversion, a theoretical approach to the conversion of two biomass (lignocellulosic and microalguae) into simple energy vector as alkanes, alcohols, carbon monoxide or hydrogen is carried out. Modelling highlights the importance of stoichiometry in the feasibility and efficiency of biomass conversions. The impact of hydrogen supply and its energy cost in improving conversion efficiency is also underlined. In terms of biomass conversion results, microalgae provide better conversion efficiency than lignocellulosic biomass. For these reactions, an optimal carbon conversion ratio is identified. The optimum conversion ratios are about 36%–46% for short chains such as methane or methanol and 64%–75% for long chains. © 2018

AB  - The research aimed to study and characterize, in a four-year study, thirteen pluri-annual herbaceous species for their potential bioethanol and biomethane production. The highest biomass yield was obtained with Arundo donax followed by Miscanthus x giganteus. Biomass cellulose content had median values ranging from 23.1% (Symphytum x uplandicum) to 45.4% (Lythrum salicaria), hemicellulose from 9.4% (Iris pseudacorus) to 36.8% (Glyceria maxima) and lignin from 2.6% (G. maxima) to 14.5% (Helianthus tuberosus and L. salicaria). The best ethanol and methane median yields were achieved by A. donax (3.5 Mg ha−1 and 8227 m3 ha−1, respectively) followed by M. x giganteus (3.2 Mg ha−1 and 4446 m3 ha−1, respectively). Methane transformation showed a higher energy output than ethanol with values ranging from 1 GJ ha−1 (Phalaris arundinacea) to 508 GJ ha−1 (A. donax) and from 1 GJ ha−1 (P. arundinacea) to 624 GJ ha−1 (A. donax) for ethanol and methane, respectively. Results showed that A. donax and M. x giganteus are the most interesting species for bioethanol and biomethane production. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cellulose extracted from cornstalk was liquefied in supercritical organic solvents at different liquefaction parameters. Different organic solvents (methanol, ethanol and acetone) were used to disintegrate cellulose at different temperatures (240, 260, 280, 300 and 320 °C), reaction time (0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min) and solvents dosage (0, 80, 120, 160 and 200 mL). The results showed that similar liquefaction characteristics of cellulose were observed in three different solvents. The larger bio-oil yield and smaller residue yield obtained from cellulose liquefaction in solvents were achieved under the suitable conditions (320 °C, 160 mL, 60–90 min), respectively. And the type of solvents was the main effect to the distribution of the composition of bio-oil. The dominant constituents of bio-oil that were produced in supercritical methanol was hydrocarbon, and ketones and esters were mainly produced in supercritical ethanol, whereas ketones compounds were primarily derived in supercritical acetone. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An efficient and green conversion process of producing 5-ethoxymethylfurfural (EMF) from corn stover was developed. The solid zeolite USY provided the good catalytic performance in ethanol medium with tetrahydrofuran (THF) as co-solvent, which can promote the formation of EMF, reducing the formation of ethyl levulinate and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural. The reaction conditions were optimized via response surface methodology leading to a maximum EMF yield of 21.8% in ethanol/THF (volume ratio 1:1) under the conditions of 168 °C, 1 wt% USY loading and 2.9 h. Meanwhile, USY can be reused in five consecutive reaction runs with high activity, upholding the same initial activity and structural integrity. A plausible reaction pathway for the conversion of corn stover to EMF in ethanol/THF medium was further proposed. This study showed that the improved catalytic system presents an efficient method for direct production of EMF from lignocellulosic biomass. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel is usually produced from edible oils which compete with the food market. Crambe abyssinica is a non-food crop referred as having high potential for biodiesel production. An entire cycle of seeding, harvesting, oil extraction and biodiesel production was performed with Crambe; probably, the first study carried out with this specie in Portugal aiming to evaluate its full viability. Biodiesel was produced from crude and refined oil of Crambe seeds cultivated (oil content of 26 ± 4 wt.%) and the results were compared to those obtained using a commercial oil originated from Brazil, where most studies are found. Biodiesel produced from the oil extracted from the Portuguese seeds showed good quality fulfilling almost all the requirements settled by EN 14214. The viscosity (5.80 mm2 s−1) and the cold filter plugging point (7 °C), which are mostly associated with the oil's nature, were close to the limits, indicating the need for blending at an industrial scale. Anyway, the biodiesel produced with the refined oil showed the highest quality, due to the lower level of contaminants. The high oxidation stability (16 h) of the biodiesel produced from seeds cultivated in Portugal can be argued as an advantage for this product. The study shows that Crambe oil might be a promising complementary alternative to the conventional edible oils used for biodiesel production. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper provides a study of injection process in a research compression ignition engine fueled with Rapeseed Methyl Ester pure biodiesel and its blends by advanced optical diagnostics and 1D model. Experimental tests have been performed in an optical direct injection single-cylinder engine equipped with the Common Rail injection system of a real compression ignition engine. The injection strategies consisted of two events per cycle, the pilot and the main. The investigated conditions were representative of two engine operating points of the WLTC corresponding to two different engine speed and brake mean effective pressure values. The 2D visible imaging and the novel infrared (IR) technique have been applied to evaluate fuel spray parameters (i.e. penetration and cone angle) for liquid and vapor phases, respectively. Experimental results have been compared to data obtained with commercial diesel fuel available from previous authors’ works, underlining the main differences. Furthermore, to improve biodiesel spray knowledge, 1D model for diesel jets has been suitably modified to analyze RME spray. The model has been set up via collected experimental data. Pure fuel and blends properties have been evaluated using REFPROP® software. Once the model has been validated, it has allowed to calculate the equivalence ratio along both the jet axis and radial direction, and the amount of vapor fuel over time. The modified 1D model presented in this study could be an advanced and effective instrument to study injection process in the modern engines fed with biofuel, supporting experimental activities in order to reduce time and costs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work describes the first documented case of an effect defined herein as “octane hyperboosting” by an oxygenated fuel compound, 3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol (prenol). Octane hyperboosting is characterized by the Research Octane Number (RON) of a mixture (e.g. an oxygenate biofuel blended into gasoline) exceeding the RON of the individual components in that mixture. This finding counters the widely held assumption that interpolation between the RON values of a pure compound and the base fuel provides the bounds for the RON performance of the blend. This is clearly distinct from the more commonly observed synergistic blending of oxygenates with gasoline, where the RON never exceeds the performance of the highest performing component. Octane hyperboosting was observed for blends of prenol and six different gasoline fuels with varying composition. Testing of compounds chemically similar to prenol yielded no qualitatively similar instances of octane hyperboosting, which suggests that the effect may not be widespread among fuel candidates. The phenomenon suggests an unexplored aspect of autoignition kinetics research for fuel blends, and may provide a new mechanism for significantly increasing fuel octane number, which is necessary for increasing combustion efficiency in spark ignition engines. This phenomenon also increases the potential candidate list of biofuels, as compounds hitherto discounted due to their lower pure component RON may exhibit hyperboosting behavior, and thereby enhanced performance, in blends. © 2018

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is the most abundant renewable resource in existence and is the only source of renewable fixed carbon. Biofuels produced from this source are promising because they do not contribute to extra CO2 emissions and they reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. Presently, wheat husk has a distinctive potential as a renewable source of biomass, due to its global availability, which is advantageous for producing liquid and gaseous fuels by thermochemical processes. The Thermo-Catalytic Reforming (TCR) process is excellent for generating energy vectors (solid char, liquid bio-oil and permanent gases) from agricultural wastes, such as wheat husk. These valorised energy vectors can be applied as transportation fuels and used in combined heat and power (CHP) plants. The aim of this work is to study the conversion of wheat husk into fuels, using TCR technology in a 2 kg/h continuous pilot scale reactor. Findings show that from 100 wt% of the feedstock, 29.6 wt% was converted into synthesis gas, 21.7 wt% to char, 5.8 wt% into organic bio-oil, 32.8 wt% into aqueous phase liquids and the remaining was attributed to losses (10.1 wt%). The organic bio-oil contains a higher heating value (HHV) of 26 MJ/kg, which represents a notable increase compared to the original feedstock (17.8 MJ/kg). Phenol was found to be the most abundant compound within the oil, with a relative abundance of 30.88% measured by GC–MS. Oleic acid (7.41%) was the most abundant long chain hydrocarbon detected. The total acid number of the oil (TAN) was (29.9 mg KOH/g) and viscosity measured (145.2 cSt). In order to use wheat husk oil as a direct engine fuel, it is necessary to carry out upgrading via hydro-processing; or blend with fossil crude oil for further refining. Overall, TCR is a promising future route for the valorisation of wheat husk to produce renewable energy vectors. © 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - The combustion of conventional fuels (diesel and Jet A-1) with 10-20% vol oxygenated biofuels (ethanol, 1-butanol, methyl octanoate, rapeseed oil methyl ester (RME), diethyl carbonate, tri(propylene glycol)methyl ether, i.e., CH3(OC3H6)3OH, and 2,5-dimethylfuran (2,5-DMF)) and a synthetic paraffinic kerosene (SPK) was studied. The experiments were performed using an atmospheric pressure laboratory premixed flame and a four-cylinder four-stroke diesel engine operating at 1500-rpm. Soot samples from kerosene blends were collected above a premixed flame for analysis. Polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were extracted from the soot samples. After fractioning, they were analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV and fluorescence detectors. C1 to C8 carbonyl compounds (CBCs) were collected at the diesel engine exhaust on 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine coated cartridges (DNPH) and analyzed by HPLC with UV detection. The data indicated that blending conventional fuels with biofuels has a significant impact on the emission of both CBCs and PAHs adsorbed on soot. The global concentration of 18 PAHs (1-methyl-naphthalene, 2-methyl-naphthalene, and the 16 U.S. priority EPA PAHs) on soot was considerably lowered using oxygenated fuels, except 2,5-DMF. Conversely, the total carbonyl emission increased by oxygenated biofuels blending. Among them, ethanol and 1-butanol were found to increase considerably the emissions of CBCs.

AB  - This work presents the phase transformations and movement dynamics in a case of complex transfer processes self-interaction on sprayed water droplets in biofuel furnace flue gases flow. The droplet phase transformation cycle is defined according to a numerical iterative scheme which is created by heat flow balance condition onto the droplet surface, where combined solutions for the tasks of external heat transfer and phase change as well as internal heat transfer in a droplet, are designed. The flue gases velocity, temperature and droplet dispersity are named as defining factors of droplets trace to full evaporation in flue gases at biofuel furnace. Relevant secondary factors are recognized as sprayed water temperature, initial velocity provided for droplets, humidity of flue gases and specifics of droplets heat transfer. It is based on, that boundary conditions, which ensures the fastest and the slowest water droplets evaporation, do not define the marginal trace of droplets till evaporation. In biofuel flue gases flow at droplet phase transformation regimes cycle two, practically equivalent periods are distinguished. In the first period significant is droplet growth due to influence of condensation, warming water expansion and droplets slipping decrease in flue gases. In the second period the trace of droplets is already defined by flue gases flow velocity. The combined droplet heating process is more significant for larger droplets, while for smaller than 70 µm diameter droplets impact of thermal radiation is neglect. © 2018

AB  - The present work involves the investigation of biodiesel characteristics derived from rice bran oil via heterogeneous basic catalytic transesterification path as the rice husk contains about 16–20% of crude rice bran oil by its weight. Engine performance and emission characteristics of rice bran oil derived biodiesel blends during fueling a four-stroke, single-cylinder, direct-injection engine at 1500 rpm were investigated. The results indicate that 20% biodiesel blend leads to a lower ignition delay at higher loads which in turn increases the rate of vaporization of the fuel as it has higher cetane umber. This fuel blend has a high in-cylinder peak pressure and heat release rate (HRR) of about 72.1 bar and 70.826 J/°CA respectively, during the pre-mixed combustion phase in rapid combustion due to the higher oxygen content. Even though, it has high viscous nature, it possesses highest brake thermal efficiency (BTE) which adds absolute combustion. The exhaust gas temperature (EGT: 7.8221%) increases with load and the observed values were matched with other biofuels. Moreover, the HCs, COx and NOx emissions decrease as the load increases since the increase in fuel atomization promotes the combustion process and thereby decreases the amount of unburnt biodiesel components. At 100% load, the smoke cloudiness level was decreased by about 21.62%. The rice bran oil and the blended (20, 30 and 40%: B20, B30 and B40) samples were tested for their notable in vitro microbial, antioxidant and nuclease bio activities due to the presence of certain bioactive components in the rice bran derived biodiesel. If the rice bran oil (RBO) is converted effectively into biodiesel, thereby it will not only satisfy 60–70% of our diesel requirement but also facilitate a green environment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Small-scale agroforestry-based biofuel production has recently been proposed as a strategy for rural poverty alleviation, but few empirical evidence is available on farmer adoption of such novel systems. This study describes adoption of oilseed tree mixtures on smallholdings in Hassan district, South India, and examines the impact of a biofuel extension program and farmer characteristics on adoption. Cross-sectional survey data and regression analyses addressing various forms of selection bias, are used. The findings reveal that tree cultivation is much more prevalent than oilseed collection, and that various activities of the biofuel extension program only stimulate the former. Low seed prices and high opportunity costs of labour are major factors impeding households to collect seeds from planted or wild oilseed species. The paper concludes that the program succeeds as an agroforestry program but not as a biofuel program. Similar challenges pertain to small-scale agroforestry systems as to jatropha-based plantation systems, although the former are a Low-Risk High-Diversity approach to build feedstock for the future. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The results obtained on wear assessment from a compression ignition (CI) engine fueled with a blend of 70% amla seed biodiesel (AB) and 30% eucalyptus oil (EU) on volume basis (called AB70EU30). The results showed stable engine operation and good operability of the engine-fuel system with the binary biodiesel fuel blend. The feasibility of this blend over a long-term endurance tests was explored. The specific assessment examination included the fate of cylinder head, pump plunger, injector nozzle, and piston crown, which affects the engine performance and engine life. The experimental results revealed better tribological performance characteristics with the binary fuel blend as compared to contemporary diesel fuel. No specific problem was encountered during the long-term endurance tests with the binary fuel blend using the modified engine parameters. The results show that the binary fuel mixture offers good potential for use as diesel fuel in CI engines while maintaining good performance and endurance. Copyright © 2019 by ASME.

AB  - This paper presents lubricating oil performance in a compression ignition (CI) engine fueled with a binary fuel blend of 70% aamla seed oil biodiesel and 30% eucalyptus oil (EU) on volume basis. This blended fuel was stable and congruent with engine-fuel system. Initially, the engine was operated with normal diesel fuel as per standard endurance test. The same endurance test was performed with the above binary biodiesel blended fuel in the engine under somewhat modified engine operational condition. The lubricating oil was examined at a specified interval to evaluate the impact of the fuel on lubricating oil properties. Quantification of various metal debris concentrations was carried out using inductive coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. After experimentation, the lubricating oil samples were analyzed using analytical ferrography that showed lower wear debris concentrations from binary biodiesel blend than diesel fuel operated engine. The better lubricating property of binary biodiesel blended fuel resulted in lower wear and improved performance of engine parts. Relatively low wear and concentrations of all metal wear were found in the lubricating oil with binary biodiesel blended fuel engine revealed better performance of engine with this fuel blend. No technical problem was encountered during the long-term endurance tests with the binary biodiesel blended fuel under modified engine parameters. Copyright © 2019 by ASME.

AB  - Sustainable feedstock supply is a critical issue for the bioenergy sector. One concern is that feedstock production will impact biodiversity. We analyze how this concern is addressed in assessments of biomass supply potentials and in selected governance systems in the EU and Brazil, including the EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED), the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), and the Brazilian Forest Act. The analysis focuses on grasslands and includes estimates of the amount of grassland area (and corresponding biomass production volume) that would be excluded from cultivation in specific biodiversity protection scenarios. The reviewed assessments used a variety of approaches to identify and exclude biodiverse grasslands as unavailable for bioenergy. Because exclusion was integrated with other nature protection considerations, quantification of excluded grassland areas was often not possible. The RED complements and strengthens the CAP in terms of biodiversity protection. Following the RED, an estimated 39%–48% (about 9–11 Mha) and 15%–54% (about 10–38 Mha) of natural and non-natural grassland, respectively, may be considered highly biodiverse in EU-28. The estimated biomass production potential on these areas corresponds to some 1–3 and 1.5–10 EJ/year for natural and non-natural grassland, respectively (depending on area availability and management intensity). However, the RED lacks clear definitions and guidance, creating uncertainty about its influence on grassland availability for bioenergy feedstock production. For Brazil, an estimated 16%–77% (about 16–76 Mha) and 1%–32% (about 7–24 Mha) of natural and non-natural grassland, respectively, may be considered highly biodiverse. In Brazil, ecological–economic zoning was found potentially important for grassland protection. Further clarification of grassland definitions and delineation in regulations will facilitate a better understanding of the prospects for bioenergy feedstock production on grasslands, and the impacts of bioenergy deployment on biodiversity. © 2018 The Authors GCB Bioenergy Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - The process of extracting lipids from high-moisture Scenedesmus quadricauda microalgae biomass disrupted with microwave was examined. The study showed that microwave pre-treatment is effective in algae cell rupture while microwave power was found to be a significant factor to enhance the degree of cell disruption. Though microwave pre-treatment time had some effect, the degree of cell rupture seemed to decrease after a certain pre-treatment time. The total lipid from Scenedesmus quadricauda sp. were extracted using a mixture methanol and sulphuric acid as an organic solvent. In addition, it was discovered that microwave pre-treatment enhances the disruption of microalgae cells to attain a high level of lipid yields. Optimal lipid yield obtained in this study was 49% at power 600 W, heating time of 8 min and extraction time of 3.5 h. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A series of 5 wt% NiO/Al-SBA-15 catalysts were prepared by wet impregnation of ordered, mesoporous Al-SBA-15 supports (Si/Al molar ratios spanning 5–75) synthesised by a true liquid crystal templating (TLCT) method. The catalytic activity of the resulting catalysts was studied in the solvent-less, hydrogen-free deoxygenation (DO) of palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD), using a semi-batch reactor at 350 °C. 27Al and 29Si MAS-NMR was used to quantify the speciation of framework and extra-framework Al as a function of Si:Al ratio, before and after NiO functionalisation; TEM and XRD confirmed the formation of 9–10 nm NiO nanoparticles in all cases. NiO/Al-SBA-15 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity for PFAD deoxygenation, with hydrocarbon yields reaching 86% and a selectivity to the diesel fraction (C11–C17) of 91%. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Residues from wine industry constitute an interesting feedstock for biodiesel in wine-producing countries like Spain. The use of grape seed oil together with bioethanol obtained from wine surplus or distillation of grape skins and stalks in the transesterification reaction results in fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE), which is a fully renewable and waste-derived biofuel. In this work, FAEE from the grape seed oil obtained from the vine variety Tempranillo has been produced and some of their properties have been measured and estimated. Only the oxidation stability would fall below the minimum value established for biodiesel in Europe, thus requiring additivation with antioxidants to fulfill the standard. The remaining properties are within the range. Noteworthy, the cold flow behaviour is very promising. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel from Palmarosa oil can be used as an alternative fuel in diesel engine. Experimental investigation was carried out to investigate the performance and emission characteristics of a diesel engine fuelled by biodiesel derived from Palmarosa oil and its blends of 25%, 50% and 100% and standard diesel fuel separately. In this study, the chemical composition of biodiesel derived from Palmarosa oil was determined by using GC-MS (Gas chromatography-mass spectrum) and FT-IR (Fourier transformed infrared) spectroscopic techniques. The results indicated the production of lower CO emission (up to 19.02%), HC emission (up to 31.25%) and smoke emission (up to 29.75%) through the use of biodiesel. However, a slight increase in NOx emission (up to 15.21%) was observed for biodiesel blends. BSFC increased by 7.41%, 19.35% and 26.47% for PMO25, PMO50 and PMO100 fuel blends respectively compared to diesel fuel. The BTE for biodiesel blends decreased when compared to diesel fuel. The combustion analysis showed a considerable increase in combustion pressure and heat release rate with shorter ignition delay and longer combustion duration. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Experiments were carried out on homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine to study its performance at different hydrogen fuel energy ratio (HFER) and loads. The engine was powered with two fuels: Hydrogen (H2) as inducted fuel along with air and diesel/Biodiesel fuel (BDF) as injected fuel. Diesel and BDF were injected into the cylinder using common rail direct injection (CRDI) facility developed. Electronic control unit (ECU) was developed to inject the fuel at any required crank angle (CA) for any magnitude of duration. At 80% load, engine operation was associated with severe knocking without exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), however engine operated well only for EGR percentage about 50% and 54% with diesel and BDFs respectively. Beyond this EGR level, HCCI engine showed misfiring and unstable combustion. At this condition, maximum HFER possible was less than 8% in both diesel and biodiesel HCCI operations and misfiring occurred beyond HFER of 8%. The maximum brake thermal efficiency (BTE) of 31.5%, 30.6% and 30.2% were reported with diesel, honge biodiesel (BHO) and cotton seed biodiesel (BCO) respectively in diesel hydrogen HCCI (DHHCCI) and biodiesel hydrogen HCCI (BHHCCI) modes. At 80% load, HCCI engine powered with BDFs showed 65–67% lower smoke, and 98–99% lower NOx emissions with HFER of 7% and EGR of 54% as compared to conventional compression ignition (CI) mode. However this engine operation resulted in nearly 11 times higher HC emissions with HFER of 7% and EGR of 54%. Hence HCCI mode of engine operation could be a feasible technological option to minimize the pollution levels besides improving the fuel economy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A commercial equilibrium FCC catalyst of the octane-barrel type was subjected to lixiviation treatments with both acidic (HNO3) and basic (NaOH) solutions in order to modify its textural and acidic properties. The alkaline lixiviation doubled the mesopore volume in the commercial catalyst, while the acidic treatment increased the concentration of crystalline component in the catalyst. The catalytic performances of the parent and modified catalysts in the immediate conversion of vapors from pine sawdust fast pyrolysis were evaluated in a fixed bed reactor at 550 °C using mass catalyst to bio-oil and tar ratios from 3 to 8. The modified catalysts both produced more hydrocarbons and less coke than the parent commercial catalyst. In turn, comparing the modified samples, the one subjected to alkali treatment was more effective in deoxygenating the pyrolysis vapors, resulting in higher hydrocarbon yields (up to 13.2%) and lower coke yields than the acid modified catalyst, a fact assigned to the higher mesoporosity which improves the diffusion transport of bulky coke precursor molecules. The acid modified catalyst allowed a higher extension of the reaction pathway, the selectivity to aromatic hydrocarbon products being much higher (up to 95.5% of hydrocarbons in the gasoline boiling range). © 2018

AB  - In this study a conventional and an improved biodiesel production plants, have been simulated in Aspen Plus V8.2. Improved process converts waste cooking oil using a reactive distillation catalyzed by a heterogeneous catalyst in which catalyst removal and neutralization units are not necessary. Using pinch technology and exergoeconoic analysis, exergy destruction of each process are calculated and the best configuration in order to integrate biodiesel production process with a combined cycle power plant is presented. The results show that the produced electricity in the modified process is less expensive. Exergy destruction to generated power ratio and the net power generation in the conventional process are equal to 1.59 and 17936.6 kW, respectively, and the corresponding values for the modified process are 1.57 and 18346.1 kW, respectively.

AB  - In this study, the effect of fuel injection pressure on the performance and emission characteristics of a diesel engine fuelled with waste cooking oil biodiesel (WCOB) and its 5–30% (v/v) blends with diesel fuel were investigated and compared with diesel fuel. The engine experiments were conducted under six different fuel injection pressures (170–220 bars), eleven different engine speeds (1000–3000 rpm), and full load to find the optimum pressure which gives best results is identified for each fuel. The results compared with diesel fuel showed that biodiesel fuels confirmed that the reductions in the engine torque, brake power, CO, UHC, and smoke opacity; however brake specific fuel consumption, exhaust gas temperature, NOX and CO2 emissions increased. On the other hand, the increased injection pressure caused to increase in the engine torques, brake powers, and brake thermal efficiencies up to 210 bar. Moreover, the increased injection pressure caused to decrease in UHC, and smoke opacity, while the increase NOX and CO2 emissions. The results indicated that fuel blends can be used in the diesel engine without any modification. When over all the results were evaluated, the optimum fuel injection pressure was found to be at 210 bar for WCOB and fuel blends. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel production using oleaginous yeasts, such as Yarrowia lipolytica, has recently attracted strong attention in terms of lipid yield and productivity. However, efficient methods of lipid extraction from oleaginous yeasts are required to further improve the economic feasibility of yeast-based biodiesel production. We investigated the effectiveness of selected switchable hydrophilicity solvents (SHSs), namely, N-ethylbutylamine (EB), N-dipropylamine (DP), and N,N-dimethylcyclohexyl-amine (DMCHA), for lipid extraction from the oleaginous yeast Y. lipolytica. Regardless of using harvested cells or culture broth, DMCHA and EB effectively extracted lipids from Y. lipolytica, resulting in up to 13% higher lipid yields than that obtained by conventional organic solvent extraction using a chloroform/methanol mixture. The lipid extracts obtained by the SHSs showed fatty acid compositions comparable to that obtained with the conventional solvent, thus assuring the quality of biodiesel produced through this method. After switching processes by purging with CO2 and N2, the lipids and solvents were successfully recovered, demonstrating the practicability of lipid extraction using SHSs. Consequently, this study provides an effective lipid extraction method for Y. lipolytica that could significantly improve energy efficiency and economic feasibility of an oleaginous-yeast-based biodiesel production process. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this paper, the acidity of MCM-41 was improved by Al addition (Si/Al molar ratio of 50) and it was used as support in nanocatalysts with various loadings of calcium (10, 20 and 30 wt %) for biodiesel production. The catalysts were synthesized by two methods: impregnation and sono-dispersion. The synthesized samples were characterized by XRD, FESEM, EDX, TEM, BET and FTIR analysis. The XRD patterns of the samples demonstrated formation of the crystalline structure of MCM-41 and CaO. The FESEM images of the samples proved the nanoscale of catalysts and along with EDX and TEM analysis showed a better dispersion of calcium on support for ultrasonic irradiated sample compared to impregnated one. The performance of nanocatalysts was examined under constant conditions (Temperature of 70 °C, Methanol/Oil ratio of 12 and catalyst loading of 10 wt %). The result showed that the conversion of transesterification reaction and following that the quality of produced biodiesel was increased significantly by increasing the calcium amounts in catalysts. Furthermore, for two samples with the same amount of calcium loading, the sonicated sample showed a higher conversion. Among all of the samples Ca(30)/Al-MCM-41(U) showed the maximum conversion for biodiesel production reaction. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Lipids extracted from algal biomass could provide an abundant, rapidly growing, high yield feedstock for bio-diesel and other green fuels to supplement current fossil-based sources. Ultrasound pretreatment is a mechanical cell disruption method that has been shown to enhance lipid recovery from algae due to cavitation effects that disrupt algae cell walls. In this study, a locally grown mixture of Chlorella vulgaris/Cyanobacteria leptolyngbya was sonicated in an ultrasonic reactor with a clamp-on transducer prior to solvent lipid extraction. This configuration allows for a non-contact delivery method of ultrasonic energy with improved operational advantages (no fouling of transducer, continuous operation, and fully scalable design). A central composite design (CCD) was implemented to statistically analyze and evaluate the effect of ultrasonic power (350–750 W) and treatment time (5–30 min) on lipid yield. Lipid recovery was found to increase with both ultrasonic power and treatment time. Total lipid yields (on dry biomass basis) extracted via the Bligh and Dyer method from Chlorella vulgaris/cyanobacteria co-culture ranged from 8.3% for untreated algae to 16.9% for algae sonicated with 750 W power for 30 min, which corresponds to more than a doubling of lipid recovery due to ultrasound pretreatment. Increased power and treatment times were found to increase the degree of cell disruption as observed in the SEM and TEM images after ultrasonic pretreatment. Additionally, hexane (1:1 v/v) was evaluated as an alternative to the standard Bligh & Dyer (2:2:1.8 v/v/v chloroform/methanol/cell suspension) lipid extraction solvent system. On average, the Bligh and Dyer method extracted on average over twice the amount of lipids compared to hexane extraction. The lipid profile of the algae extracts indicates high concentrations of lauric acid (12:0), palmitic acid (16:0), stearic acid (18:0), oleic acid (18:1), and linoleic acid (18:2). This particular configuration of an ultrasonic system proved to be a viable method for the pretreatment of algae for enhanced lipid yields. Future research should focus on identifying alternative extraction solvents and expanding the range of treatment conditions to optimize the ultrasonic power and treatment times for maximum lipid recovery. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - European climate policy faced increasing constraints during the economic and Eurozone crises (2008–2014). The European Commission subsequently refocused policymaking toward integrating climate objectives into other policy areas such as energy and the 2014–2020 European Union (EU) budget. The conditions for successful climate policy integration (CPI) are analyzed, focusing on the compatibility of key actors’ beliefs. In renewable energy policy, CPI was successful as long as the co-benefits and related policy-core beliefs of energy security, rural economic development and climate action coexisted harmoniously. Once conflict among these policy-core beliefs emerged during the biofuels controversy, CPI was weakened as actors with competing economy-focused beliefs controlled the decision-making process. The case of EU budget climate mainstreaming illustrates how actors can add climate objectives into legislation despite meaningful discussion being ‘crowded out’ by other priorities. The findings highlight the importance of low conflict between departments, compatible beliefs and policy priorities for successful CPI. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Humic-like substances (HULIS) are a mixture of high-molecular-weight, water-soluble organic compounds that are widely distributed in atmospheric aerosol. Their sources are rarely studied quantitatively. Biomass burning is generally accepted as a major primary source of ambient humic-like substances (HULIS) with additional secondary material formed in the atmosphere. However, the present study provides direct evidence that residential coal burning is also a significant source of ambient HULIS, especially in the heating season in northern China based on source measurements, ambient sampling and analysis, and apportionment with source-oriented CMAQ modeling. Emission tests show that residential coal combustion produces 5% to 24% of the emitted organic carbon (OC) as HULIS carbon (HULISc). Estimation of primary emissions of HULIS in Beijing indicated that residential biofuel and coal burning contribute about 70% and 25% of annual primary HULIS, respectively. Vehicle exhaust, industry, and power plant contributions are negligible. The average concentration of ambient HULIS in PM2:5 was 7.5 ugm 3 in urban Beijing and HULIS exhibited obvious seasonal variations with the highest concentrations in winter. HULISc accounts for 7.2% of PM2:5 mass, 24.5% of OC, and 59.5% of water-soluble organic carbon. HULIS are found to correlate well with KC, Cl , sulfate, and secondary organic aerosol, suggesting its sources include biomass burning, coal combustion, and secondary aerosol formation. Source apportionment based on CMAQ modeling shows residential biofuel and coal burning and secondary formation are important sources of ambient HULIS, contributing 47.1 %, 15.1 %, and 38.9 %, respectively. © 2019.

AB  - Background: Lignocellulosic biomass is considered as a potential source for sustainable biofuels. In the conversion process, a pretreatment step is necessary in order to overcome the biomass recalcitrance and allow for sufficient fermentable sugar yields in enzymatic hydrolysis. Steam explosion is a well known pretreatment method working without additional chemicals and allowing for efficient particle size reduction. However, it is not effective for the pretreatment of softwood and the harsh conditions necessary to achieve a highly digestible cellulose fraction lead to the partial degradation of the hemicellulosic sugars. Previous studies showed that the autohydrolysis pretreatreatment of softwood can benefit from the addition of 2-naphthol. This carbocation scavenger prevents lignin repolymerisation leading to an enhanced glucose yield in the subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis. Results: In order to prevent the degradation of the hemicellulose, we investigated in this study a two-stage 2-naphthol steam explosion pretreatment. In the first stage, spruce wood is pretreated at a severity which is optimal for the autocatalytic hydrolysis of the hemicellulose. The hydrolyzate containing the solubilized sugars is withdrawn from the reactor and the remaining solids are pretreated with different amounts of 2-naphthol in a second stage at a severity that allows for high glucose yields in enzymatic hydrolysis. The pretreated spruce was subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis and to simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF). In the first stage, the maximal yield of hemicellulosic sugars was 47.5% at a pretreatment severity of log R-0 R 0 = 3.75 at 180 °C. In the second stage, a 2-naphthol dosage of 0.205 mol/mol lignin C 9 -unit increased the ethanol yield in SSF with a cellulose loading of 1% using the whole second stage pretreatment slurry by 17% from 73.6% for the control without 2-naphthol to 90.4%. At a higher solid loading corresponding to 5% w/w cellulose, the yields decreased due to higher concentrations of residual 2-naphthol in the biomass and the pretreatment liquor, but also due to higher concentrations of potential inhibitors like HMF, furfural and acetic acid. Experiments with washed solids, vacuum filtered solids and the whole slurry showed that residual 2-naphthol can inhibit the fermentation as a single inhibitor but also synergistically together with HMF, furfural and acetic acid. Conclusions: This work shows that a two-stage pretreatment greatly enhances the recovery of hemicellulosic sugars from spruce wood. The presence of 2-naphthol in the second pretreatment stage can enhance the ethanol yield in SSF of steam explosion pretreated softwood at low cellulose concentrations of 1% w/w. However, with higher solid loadings of 5% w/w cellulose, the ethanol yields were in general lower due to the solid effect and a synergistic inhibition of HMF, furfural, acetic acid with residual 2-naphthol. The concentration of residual 2-naphthol tolerated by the yeast decreased with increasing concentrations of HMF, furfural, and acetic acid. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - As renewable electricity sources emerge, the conversion of electricity and CO 2 to carbon-based fuels (e-fuels) arises as a complementary or competing option to biofuels. This work provides a systematic performance comparison of both bio-and e-fuel pathways to identify characteristic differences and optimal applications of both production types. We construct a reaction network that features biochemical and thermochemical conversion of lignocellulosic biomass, transesterification of waste vegetable oil, and e-based routes (E-routes) using renewable H 2 . The network is optimized for economic and environmental criteria using two pathway screening tools, i.e., Reaction Network Flux Analysis and Process Network Flux Analysis. Furthermore, we apply a linear combination metric to analyze the advantages of bio-e-hybrid designs on a global fleet level. The results show that lignocellulosic-based fuels are relatively inexpensive but typically incur energy-intensive separations and high carbon losses. E-routes, on the contrary, result in only small carbon losses and global warming potentials as low as 5 gCO2,eq.MJfuel. However, they come at high cost due to the use of expensive renewable H 2 . When combinations are considered, biomass can be utilized by upgrading it with e-based H 2 . In the case of bio-e-hybrid ethanol plants, co-fermentation of sugars and utilization of CO 2 emitted during fermentation are identified as viable low-cost options for carbon loss reduction. These hybrid pathway designs outperform combinations of purely bio-based and purely e-based pathways at the fleet level. Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to experimentally investigate the effect of unsaturation of the biodiesels obtained from grapeseed oil, wheat germ oil and coconut oil (reference fuel) for compression ignition (CI) engine application. Fatty acid profile analysis and physio-chemical properties were determined by standard test procedures. Engine testing was carried out in a 5.2-kW single-cylinder CI engine and the combustion, performance and emission characteristics were analysed. The effect of fuel property variation and the combustion reaction kinetics due to unsaturation difference have been discussed. The maximum brake thermal efficiency at full load for diesel was found to be 32.3% followed by 31.3%, 30.2% and 27.4 %, respectively, for coconut biodiesel (CBD), grapeseed biodiesel (GSBD) and wheat germ biodiesel (WGBD). Maximum heat release rate as observed for diesel, CBD, GSBD and WGBD are 63.2 J/°CA 60.7 J/°CA and 59 J/°CA and 43.4 J/°CA respectively. The brake-specific NO emission at full load is higher for CBD followed by GSBD, WGBD and diesel having values of 9.23 g/kWh, 8.91 g/kWh, 8.21 g/kWh and 7.6 g/kWh respectively. Conversely, the smoke emission is lower for CBD compared to the other tested fuels. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The present study aims to investigate the optimum condition of stationary diesel engine’s operating parameters to obtain better performance and emission level, where the diesel engine is fueled with different concentrations of soybean biodiesel (SB), water, and alumina (Al) nanoadditive. Taguchi method coupled with gray relational analysis has been implemented in this study to obtain the optimum concentration of SB, water, and Al nanoparticle, and statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA) is applied to obtain the individual response of operating parameters on overall engine performance and emission level. Various concentration of SB (10%, 20%, and 30%), water (10%, 20%, and 30%), and Al nanoparticle (50 ppm, 100 ppm, and 150 ppm) are mixed with base diesel (BD) by mechanical agitation and followed by an ultra-sonication process. The fuel properties are measured based on EN590 standards, and the experiments are conducted in a single-cylinder, four-stroke, natural aspirated stationary diesel engine based on an L 9 orthogonal array fuel combination. From the obtained gray relational co-efficient (GRC) and signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio, the optimum concentration of SB, water, and nanoadditive are identified as 20%, 10%, and 100 ppm, respectively, and a confirmation experiment has also been carried out to confirm the improvements at optimum condition. The ANOVA results imply that water concentration (WC) has the maximum influence on overall diesel engine’s performance and emission level followed by nanoparticle and SB concentrations. Overall, it can be concluded that the engine exhibits better performance and greener emissions at optimal condition. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In the present study, a multistage route is proposed for the treatment of biodiesel industry wastewater (BWW) containing around 1000 mg L −1 of total organic carbon (TOC), 3500 mg L −1 of chemical oxygen demand (COD), and 1325 mg L −1 of oil and grease. Initially, BWW aerobic biodegradability was assessed via Zhan-Wellens biodegradability test to confirm the appropriate treatment route. Then, a hybrid moving bed bioreactor (MBBR) system was chosen as the first treatment stage. The hybrid MBBR achieved 69 and 68% removal of COD and TOC removals, respectively, and provided great conditions for biomass growth. The bacterial community present in the hybrid MBBR was investigated by PCR-DGGE and potential biodegraders were identified such as: members of Desulfuromonadales, Nocardioidaceae and Pseudomonadaceae. Since biodegradation in the hybrid MBBR alone was unable to meet quality requirements, advanced oxidation processes, such as Fenton and photo-Fenton, were optimized for application as additional treatment stages. Physicochemical properties and acute toxicity of BWW were analyzed after the multistage routes: hybrid MBBR + Fenton, hybrid MBBR + photo-Fenton and hybrid MBBR + UV-C 254nm /H 2 O 2 . Hybrid MBBR + Fenton or photo-Fenton showed overall COD removal efficiencies greater than 95% and removed acute toxicity, thus being appropriate integrated routes for the treatment of real BWW.

AB  - Pinewood sawdust and the waste rubber from truck tyres have been co-pyrolysed in order to improve the properties of bio-oil for its integration in oil refineries. In addition, an analysis has been conducted of the effect the interactions between these two materials’ pyrolysis reactions have on product yields and properties. Biomass/tyre mixing ratios of 100/0, 75/25, 50/50, 25/75 and 0/100 by weight percentage have been pyrolysed in continuous mode at 500 °C in a conical spouted bed reactor, obtaining oil yields in the 55.2–71.6 wt% range. Gaseous, oil and solid fractions have been characterised for the 50/50 biomass/tyre mixture, paying special attention to the oil fraction by determining its detailed composition, elemental analysis and calorific value. Co-processing enables the stabilization of the liquid, as the co-pyrolysis oil has a stable single phase, being composed mainly of water, aromatic hydrocarbons and phenols in concentrations of 14.5, 11.1 and 9.7 wt%, respectively. Adding tyre rubber to the biomass in the pyrolysis feed improves the oil's properties, as a liquid with higher carbon content and lower oxygen and water is obtained, even if sulphur content is also increased. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Solid alcohols based on waste cooking oil (WCO) and other edible oils (butter or soybean oil) were synthesized by a simple one-step method. The effects of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) dosage and type of oil on the combustion performances were explored. IR spectroscopy and micro-morphologies of the oil based solid alcohols were also studied. Results showed that, for oil based solid alcohol, use of an appropriate excess of NaOH and an oil with lower iodine value produced the solid alcohol with better combustion performance. Centrifugation produced the bottom waste cooking oil (B-WCO) with lower iodine value and the supernatant waste cooking oil (S-WCO) with higher iodine value. The B-WCO afforded solid alcohol with longer combustion time, higher melting temperature and relatively low combustion residue rate, whereas the S-WCO could be used for synthesizing biodiesel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The ongoing requirements for fuel in meeting the ever-growing demand in commercial sector have pushed researchers in finding and optimizing the production of biofuels from cheap sources, enabling for a sustainable production. The present study aims at bridging the gap in optimizing the process parameters which are required for converting cheap waste cooking oil (WCO) into methyl esters, using cost effective source of heterogeneous catalyst (Egg shells). Characterization of synthesized calcium oxide (CaO) and the methyl esters were performed. Catalyst calcinations temperature (CTemp), catalyst calcinations time (CTime), catalyst loading (CL), alcohol to oil ratio (AO), reaction temperature (RTemp) and reaction time (RTime) were being analyzed in a 3-level-6-factor array using an L27 Taguchi orthogonal array (OA). Response surface methodology (RSM) optimization and analysis of variance (ANOVA) test are carried out for determining the most significant parameter. Amongst the entire variable, the transesterification reaction temperatures have a contribution of 30.14%, followed by calcinations temperature with 29.70%. A confirmation test is conducted using the optimal values from both RSM and ANOVA and a yield of 96.6 ± 0.05% and 96.3 ± 0.10% respectively is obtained which is more than the predicted value of 96.08% and at par with studies of researchers work. Thus, at same OA design, RSM and ANOVA can be equally applied for optimization. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

The packed alumina enhanced the ester content up to 20%; but it had no effect on the acetin content. Furthermore, this study also intended to determine the effects of the acetin content and thermal cracking on 19 fuel properties of lipid-based biofuel samples synthesized by supercritical ethyl acetate. The optimal condition was found at 380 °C, 20 MPa and ethyl acetate to oil molar ratio of 30:1. First, the density and kinematic viscosity of the biofuels were slightly higher than the maximum values specified by standards because of the presence of triacetin and polymerized products. Second, packing alumina balls increase the mixing intensity and thermal conductivity inside the tubular reactor resulted in higher contents of sulfated ash and carbon residue. Third, the acid values of the biofuel samples were considerably higher than the standard value of biodiesel. However, copper strip corrosion testing resulted in slight tarnishing (level 1A). The corrosiveness of fuels mainly originates from their sulfur compound content, neither biofuel sample was classified as a corrosive material. Furthermore, the high acid values of the samples interfered with the testing of oxidation stability. Finally, beneficial effects of triacetin on cold flow properties were revealed in this study. The cloud point and cold filter plugging point of lipid-based biofuels strongly depended on the thermal stress of the reaction conditions rather than the triacetin concentration. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The presented paper focuses on the combustion analysis of a highly oxygenated, viscous and economically viable fuel in an internal combustion micro gas turbine. Results suggest that environmental benefits in terms of NOx emissions and PM emissions are significant as concentrations of both species are reduced. Based on the analysis presented in the study, altered local air-fuel ratio suppresses NOx formation and PM formation resulting in 10-fold lower PM emission than same experimental apparatus with diesel fuel. The study further analyses and identifies three key mechanisms that are responsible for this reduction: altered oxygen profile during mixture preparation, prevention of soot precursors formation and promotion of soot oxidation reactions. The influence of tested fuel is also perceivable through higher CO and THC emissions. Parametric analysis within the selected experimental space suggests that operational parameters of the micro gas turbine can be adjusted to reduce concentrations of these two species without negatively affecting other pollutants. Significant benefits of the fuel in terms of environmental impact indicate that further investigation and development of this approach might provide a new alternative energy source for stationary use as well as for mobility in sectors where heavy duty gas turbines are used as prime movers. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Genset engines are popular for power backup as well as for agricultural applications in rural areas. However these engines are noisy and emit toxic pollutants. It is therefore important to develop noise reduction methodologies for genset engines since noise regulations are becoming increasingly stringent globally. Experimental investigations were carried out on a single cylinder engine to assess combustion, noise and vibration characteristics using Soyabean and Rapeseed biofuels (straight vegetable oil (SVO) and Biodiesel). In addition, performance and emission characteristics of these fuels were also investigated. Through this study, it has been found that there is a strong correlation between the heat release rate (HRR) and combustion noise as well as external noise. Higher was the HRR, higher were the magnitudes of combustion noise and external noise. Similar correlation also existed for vibrations. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To meet the expected requirements of the proposed EU Renewable Energy Directive for the next decade (RED II), it is necessary to increase the availability of second-generation biofuels. One promising way of doing this involves using ablative fast pyrolysis units to transform an agricultural by-product, for example straw, into bio-oil. To obtain straw bio-oil suitable for processing in a typical refinery, we optimized the key parameters of its hydrotreatment. For the upgrading, a continuous flow reactor with a fixed bed of a commercial sulphide NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst was used. The reaction temperature and pressure were tested at 240–360 °C and 2–8 MPa, respectively. The reaction off-gas was analysed by GC-FID/TCD. A detailed physicochemical analysis of the products was carried out. Under most conditions tested, the product was separated into an aqueous and an organic phase. For the best products, &gt;85% of the feed energy content remained in the organic phase and a significant decrease in viscosity and acidity was achieved. The product prepared at 360 °C and 8 MPa was the only one completely miscible with straight-run gas oil and, thus, appears to be the most suitable for co-processing in a refinery. © 2018 The Author(s)

AB  - We show that early-stage evaluation of critical fuel properties of new gasoline or diesel blendstock candidates can be accomplished using small volumes of material (<15 mL, compared to the ∼1 L typically required). The approach utilizes dilution and autoignition resistance via measurement of ignition delay to estimate the octane number or cetane number of a new blendstock. The ignition delay can be converted to a derived cetane number and derived octane number, providing a useful estimate of a critical combustion property. The results were validated against known compounds. Measurement of autoignition is important for evaluating blendstocks derived from biomass, where generating large volumes for initial evaluation may be prohibitively expensive. We have used this approach for several materials identified as having potential biological production pathways. Also, synthetic organic chemistry was employed to produce sufficient quantities of samples for autoignition measurement for those materials with no established biological scale-up route. The materials investigated were isomers of 5,5-dimethyl-2-ethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene; branched alcohols and ketones; and hydrotreated terpenoid mixtures. Several candidates were identified with favorable fuel properties for either gasoline (derived research octane number greater than 90) or diesel (derived cetane number higher than 40). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel, an alternative energy source, is promoted as cleaner and safer than other fuel options due to its reported reduction of particulate and gaseous emissions (CO2, CO, and total hydrocarbons). However, its volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) emissions are key to understanding its toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic risk factors. This research was developed to assess the genotoxic impact of exhaust emissions using biodiesel from animal fat, palm oil and soybean oil blended with diesel (B80). Diluted exhaust gases were analyzed simultaneously for pollutant emissions and for toxicity using an exposure chamber called the BioToxMonitor, where Tradescantia pallida and a KU-20 clone were exposed to exhaust following Trad-MCN and Trad-SH bioassays. The results show differences in the emission compositions and considerable mutagenic potential among the three biodiesels tested, with palm oil biodiesel emissions being the least harmful, based on its low pollutant concentrations and the negative response in the TradSH bioassay. In contrast, the animal fat biodiesel and soybean oil biodiesel emissions were as toxic as the diesel emissions, being positive in both Trad bioassays. This could be related to the PAH and carbonyl concentrations found in the vehicular exhaust. The genotoxicity of diesel emissions was related to PM1 and the concentrations of both gas and particle PAHs concentrations, which were two times higher compared to the highest concentrations observed for biodiesel. The data suggest that micronucleus assays in Tradescantia pallida are more sensitive for gaseous pollutant exposure. This is the first reported study of biodiesel exhaust biomonitoring in situ and under controlled conditions inside an exposure chamber. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - ETS-10, zeolite A and sepiolite based nano-structured materials were prepared and modified with potassium containing compounds using ion-exchange or impregnation and evaluated as basic catalysts for transesterification of vegetable oils using microwave heating. The structural features of these catalysts were characterised in detail by the variable temperature in situ X-ray diffraction, N 2 adsorption–desorption, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray analysis and in situ FTIR spectroscopy using adsorption–desorption of acetylene as a basic probe in order to evaluate their structure–catalytic performance relationship in the methanolysis of triglycerides. A wide range of parameters were utilised in order to optimise the reaction conditions. Although a high yield of fatty acid methyl esters with almost 100% selectivity can be achieved in transesterification reactions in the presence of K-containing sepiolite, this system shows significant deactivation due to its structural degradation and loss of the active component during the reaction and regeneration cycles. In contrast, zeolite KA and ETS-10, which are thermally stable crystalline materials, demonstrated no decrease in their activity for up to four reaction runs, and therefore can be used as effective solid basic catalysts in this reaction. Here we explore for the first time how the thermal and structural stability of the supported clay can affect its activity, an essential issue which has not been sufficiently studied in the recent research related to the biofuel production over solid catalysts. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - The need to develop an alternative fuel to fossil fuel is growing day by day, especially for the transportation industry, as the supply of fossil fuels is limited and is depleting at a rapid rate. One available resource that has emerged recently is biodiesel. However, the usage of biodiesel is very low among transportation companies. An investigation into the barriers of adopting biodiesel by transportation companies is the focus of the present study. A survey of 147 transportation companies in Malaysia was undertaken, and the data gathered were analyzed using partial least squares technique. Lack of government support, lack of environmental-commercial benefits, and lack of competitive pressure were found to be the barriers to biodiesel adoption. The results also indicated that differentiation strategy moderates the impact of lack of government support, lack of customer demand, lack of environmental-commercial benefits and lack of competitive pressure on biodiesel adoption. The results of this study could benefit policy makers by providing them key focus areas in which they can modify their strategies to actively and successfully promote the use of biodiesel among transportation companies in developing countries. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - One approach to effectively control the rapid expansion of water hyacinth is to use it as a feedstock in producing valuable goods. While it is technically feasible to produce bioethanol using water hyacinth, the economic feasibility of this valorization is yet unknown. This article conducted an ex-ante cost-benefit analysis of the production of bioethanol from water hyacinth. The results show that in comparison with the active control approach of collection and landfill, it is economically feasible to produce bioethanol from the collected biomass. In addition to its contribution to energy diversification, the production of bioethanol using water hyacinth as a feedstock cannot only control the rapid expansion of water hyacinth but can also contribute to carbon emissions reduction and water quality improvement. While the production cost of bioethanol is high, environmental values play an important role in the economic justification of the production. The coupled use of water hyacinth as a phytoremediation plant and bioethanol feedstock is a potential response to green development strategies. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Biodiesel is a potentially low-carbon, renewable alternative fuel to diesel, sharing similar chemical and physical properties to diesel. There have been significant efforts in introducing primarily bioethanol and some biodiesel to the road transport sector, with varying levels of success. However, the rail sector has not seen as large an effort in introducing biodiesel. This paper summarizes the literature on the introduction of biodiesel (bioethanol was a relevant fuel) in order to learn lessons, which can be applied to the rail transport sector. A decision-making framework PESTLE (Political/Policies, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, and Environmental) is used to analyze these lessons, and their relevance (or not) to the rail sector. While introduction of biodiesel in the rail sector has some inherent advantages, such as fewer refueling points, customers and manufacturers compared to the road sector, it also faces some challenges, especially in the context of the longer life of locomotives, making fleet turnover and potential transition to 100% biodiesel slow. Additionally, maintenance costs are still uncertain. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The growing demand for energy has promoted research on alcohol-based biofuels. Fusel oil is a long-chain alcohol (higher alcohol), which is a byproduct of the bioethanol synthesis process and has recently received attention as a fuel blend for compression ignition and spark-ignition engines. Although several researches have been performed for using fusel oil in internal combustion engines, it is still unclear what is the optimum fusel oil ratio in blend. The present study focuses on determining optimum fusel oil gasoline blend ratio and operation load for a spark ignition engine. The response surface method (RSM), which is a widely used optimization technique to product and evaluate the biofuels, was used to analyze the performance and emissions of a port fuel injected gasoline engine burning different blends of fusel oil and gasoline (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%) under different loads (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100%) and a fixed engine speed of 2500 rpm. The most compatible model was obtained and predicted values were successfully validated with the experimental observations. All RSM models were significant at the 5% level. Optimization results suggested 25% fusel oil content with an engine load of 47.21%. According to these optimized operating conditions, the engine torque was 16.49 Nm and brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) was 326.024 g/kWh. The emissions of CO, NOx and UHC at this point were 0.88%, 568.3 ppm and 165.49 ppm, respectively. According to engine test results, brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and brake torque decreased while the gross BSFC increased duo to water content in fusel oil which resulted in dramatically reduced in in-cylinder temperatures. With increasing the fusel oil content from G80F20 (80% gasoline-20% fuel oil) to G0F100 (0% gasoline-100% fuel oil), the NOX emissions reduced by 41% while UHC and CO emissions increased about by 39% and 22%, respectively. A higher desirability value of 0.63 for regression model illustrated that RSM can be efficiently employed for modeling and optimization of engine operating parameters. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The objective of the present study is to evaluate the effect of several variables, including different levels of biodiesel and ethanol in diesel blended fuel (biodiesel-ethanol-diesel blends), engine load and rotational speed, on the performance indicators of a diesel engine. Design of experiments was conducted as central composite rotatable designs using response surface method. The results showed that increasing biodiesel and/or ethanol percentages in the fuel blends caused to reduce the engine brake power. A low level of biodiesel and/or ethanol in the fuel blends could enhance the engine brake thermal efficiency in comparison with the pure diesel fuel or high level of biodiesel and/or ethanol in the diesel fuel blends. The highest value of the engine brake power occurred on the condition for pure diesel, engine load of 100% (full load) and rotational speed of 2800 rpm, whereas the highest value of thermal efficiency was observed at D83B12E5 blended fuel, engine load of 80% and rotational speed of 1900 rpm. However, the specific fuel consumption, with a minimum at the pure diesel, full load and engine rotational speed of 2453 rpm, increased with increment biodiesel and/or ethanol percentage in the fuel blends. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The scarcity of fossil oils in medium and long term has led to propose different alternatives to replace it, and this is the reason why biodiesel has been proposed as a suitable replacement of conventional diesel oil. One of the most widely inquired heterogeneous catalysts in biodiesel production is calcium oxide (CaO) due to some advantages such as low price and high activity. Unfortunately, this compound is leached by methanol, and in this case, compounds such as CaO and ZnO have been suggested as an alternative to avoid this unwanted phenomenon. According to this, in the current work mixed oxides of calcium–zinc catalysts were synthesized using the co-precipitation method, and later, they were characterized and their behaviors were studied identifying transesterification yields and catalysts life cycle varying some of its operational conditions. Methanol/oil ratio over catalyst amount and Zn/Ca atomic ratio were identified as the main factors that affect the transesterification reaction yield. The maximum yield was 86.99%, obtained with 7.5 wt% catalyst, Zn/Ca atomic ratio of 3.0, methanol/oil molar ratio of 30:1 and a reaction time of 2 h at 56.9 °C. To test its reactivation capacity, a reactivated catalyst with the best behavior was used again obtaining a yield of 83.87% which indicates an insignificant decrease in its catalytic activity. However, the leaching process was detected which does not allow a decrease in purification costs due to residual calcium oxide. © 2018, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

AB  - The depletion of exhaustible underground petroleum resources has put the present civilization at stake, thereby warranting intense research on non-exhaustible fuel. With this energy crisis hitting the block, microorganisms such as yeasts are gaining wider importance as potential biofuel candidates. An indigenous yeast strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolated from laboratory-scale brewing was investigated for biodiesel production. Biodiesel was produced by in situ transesterification approach using 1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidine as the catalyst. The fuel properties such as viscosity, density, calorific value and cetane number (CN) were determined to assess the fuel quality of S. cerevisiae biodiesel. Additionally, the investigation also focuses on theoretical studies considering the yeast de-oiled cake (low-value biomass refuse). Fatty acid methyl ester analysis revealed that biodiesel was primarily composed of tricosylic acid (C23:0, 28.71%), palmitoleic acid (C16:1, 28.96%) and oleic acid (C18:1, 18.13%). Eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5, 2.01%), one of the most commonly known polyunsaturated fatty acid, was present in the yeast strain. The CN of yeast biodiesel was 71.58, which was much higher than petro-diesel. The theoretical findings suggest the competitiveness of yeast biomass conversion technologies with petroleum refining process economics. The overall study warrants the feasibility of co-production of biodiesel from S. cerevisiae and cracked biofuel products (from S. cerevisiae de-oiled cake) under the aegis of biorefining applications. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - An increase in greenhouse gas effect and depletion of fossil fuel leads to work on alternate renewable source of energy. Biofuel, in which biodiesel has gained its importance over a decade due to its promising characteristics. Crude glycerol is produced as an inevitable byproduct during biodiesel production. The carbon content of the waste glycerol can be utilized by many microorganisms as a cheap carbon and energy source for the production of high value chemicals like ethanol, citric acid, propanediol etc. In this present work simple sequential procedures like distillation, acidification, activated charcoal adsorption, filtration and centrifugation were carried out made to remove major impurities economically and increases the glycerol concentration. The removal of impurities from crude glycerol and the increase in the concentration of glycerol were witnessed from GCMS and GC-FID reports. The procedure followed in this work provided a realistic and concrete target shows a momentous proliferation of increased glycerol concentration from 10.43% to 44 %. The other properties of glycerol were studied and compared with standard methods. © RJPT All right reserved.

AB  - Considering world energy demand and its security, much attention has been focused on identifying promising lignocellulosic substrates to generate a variety of downstream fuels and chemicals. In response, a recent key research area has centered on hydrolysis of cell wall polysaccharides by various physical, chemical and biological means. Due to their complex chemical and molecular structure, there is a substantial knowledge gap in understanding of biomass recalcitrance and its relationship with cell wall structure. It has delayed the response in meeting the target to achieve economically feasible large-scale conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to biofuel and market entrance. Biomass of wheat straw, rice straw, corn stover, sugarcane bagasse and switchgrass has been characterized to assess their potential for bioenergy application. The mechanism involved in digestibility of lignocellulosic biomass is complex since it is hindered by many physico-chemical, structural and compositional factors. This paper highlights recent advances in analytical methods employed for physico-chemical characterization of lignocellulosic biomass and its deconvolution to maximize the benefit of biomass as a material and energy feedstock. © 2019, Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, Romania.

AB  - Anhydrous bioethanol is a material used in many applications including biofuel. Commonly, bioethanol is produced through sugar fermentation which results in a low concentration of ethanol. For utilization as biofuel, the lowest ethanol concentration should be 99.5%. Distillation is common technique to dry a mixture solution, however, the mixture of bioethanol and water is forming an azeotrope that limit the concentration of 96% ethanol. This paper discusses ethanol dehydration through extractive batch distillation by the addition of a ternary solute sodium hydroxide, citric acid, sulfuric acid, glycerol or ethylene glycol to ethanol. The initial concentration of ethanol used was 86% v/v, and the amount of ternary solute added was selected based on the colligative properties of the solution, which included a boiling point elevation (ΔT B ) that ranged from 5 to 25 °C. All the ternary solutes could break or shift the ethanol-water azeotrope. The highest concentration of ethanol was 99.91% v/v at ΔT B = 25 °C with sulfuric acid as the ternary component. The resulted ethanol concentration exhibited a linear relationship with ΔT B , which was also affected by the boiling point of the ternary solute. This study successfully produced anhydrous bioethanol by low cost and simple distillation process. © 2019, Malaysian Society of Analytical Sciences. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this article, a comparative study of hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO) and diesel was performed in two constant volume combustion rigs and an optical accessible compression-ignited chamber (OACIC). Ignition, combustion, and nitric oxide (NO) emissions were studied under constant ambient gas density of 16.4 kg/m3, 21% vol oxygen concentration, and two different injection pressures of 800 and 1000 bar. Emission of NO was measured only in the OACIC, while a line-of-sight soot temperature distribution by applying two-color pyrometry was investigated in both setups. In general, the HVO as alternative fuel showed shorter ignition delay and less NO emission than diesel for both injection pressures. Due to difference in the molecular structure, soot temperature of biofuel flames had narrower temperature spectrum than conventional fuel. Moreover, this study reveals the significance of wall-jet interaction for utilization of the biofuel. The HVO was not found to bounce off the wall as conventional diesel, which led to relatively long flame residence time for the tested biofuel. Based on the revealed results, it is clear that a diesel engine operated on biodiesel will be characterized by lower NOx emissions comparatively to the one operated on conventional diesel fuel. This will ultimately lead to reduced energy consumption for exhaust gas aftertreatment in order to comply with environmental regulations. At the same time, the shift toward HVO, due to its both physical and thermodynamic properties, will require additional optimization of combustion chamber geometry and injection system and readjusting the injection strategies and timings.

AB  - Biodiesel is a fuel that can be originated from different raw materials. However, even a good quality biodiesel has its properties strongly dependent upon its fatty acid profile. For instance, samples with a high content of saturated fatty acids may present poor cold flow properties, meaning that they tend to solidify under low temperatures. In this work, we propose to synthesize polymer additives and apply them as cold flow improvers for palm methyl esters (biodiesel) and their blends with petrodiesel. The synthetic additives were evaluated at different concentrations to assess their effect on the pour point (PP) of the resulting neat or blended biofuel. By using 1000 ppm of poly(dodecyl acrylate-co-tetradecyl methacrylate), it was possible to decrease the PP of B5 (5 vol.% biodiesel + 95 vol.% diesel) and B20 (20 vol.% biodiesel + 80 vol.% diesel) to −35 °C and −14 °C, respectively, which allowed the use of these blends in regions where their flow properties would eventually be prohibitive. However, the performance of the additive on the neat fuel (B100) was negligible. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - The effects of using blends of unleaded gasoline and refined fusel oil on engine performance and exhaust emissions were analyzed. Prior to the experiment, the fusel oil, which is the final waste product of the sugar factory, was developed to have the chemical properties that can be used in internal combustion engines by removing water and gum contained therein. A four-stroke, single-cylinder, spark-ignition engine was used for the experiments. The tests were conducted at a fixed speed and under different loads. The test fuels were blended with fusel oil contents of 5%, 15%, and 30%. Under each load, the engine's performance and emissions were measured. Throughout the experiments, it was observed that engine torque and fuel consumption increased as the amount of fusel oil in the blend increased. Nitrogen oxide (NO x ), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions were reduced as the amount of fusel oil in the blends increased. © 2019 North Carolina State University.

AB  - The establishment of catalyst systems for the chemoselective hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of carboxylic acids to hydrocarbons, such as the HDO of long-chain fatty acids to alkanes, is important for biomass to biofuel conversion. As the most abundant and probably the cheapest transition metal on the earth, iron is a promising non-noble-metal alternative to precious metals for large-scale conversion of biomass. However, it usually suffers from unsatisfactory activity. In this work, a nitrogen-doped carbon-alumina hybrid supported iron (Fe-N-C@Al 2 O 3 ) catalyst is established for chemoselective HDO of carboxylic acids to hydrocarbons. By using stearic acid HDO as the model reaction, n-octadecane and n-heptadecane are produced with yields of 91.9% and 6.0%, respectively. Triglycerides can also be converted into liquid alkanes with a total molar yield of &gt;92%. In addition, the iron catalyst can chemoselectively catalyze the HDO of the carboxylic acid group in the presence of other functional groups such as an aromatic ring. This chemoselectivity has rarely been seen before because the aromatic ring is usually more easily hydrogenated in comparison to HDO of the carboxylic acid group. The characterization results showed that both the formation of a nitrogen-doped carbon-alumina hybrid and the iron loading are important for the Lewis basicity of these catalysts, in order to adsorb the acid substrates. The addition of melamine as the nitrogen precursor during pyrolysis eliminates undesired reactions between the iron precursor and alumina support to form an inactive hercynite phase, leading to the formation of an Fe 3 C active phase for the hydrogenation of -COOH to -CH 2 OH and the hybrid of N-C and alumina for the HDO of -CH 2 OH to -CH 3 . © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - We show that confined impinging jet mixers (CIJMs) improve lipid extraction from microalgae. CIJMs turbulently mix organic solvent into algae suspensions. Turbulent flow shrinks the Kolmogorov length between algae cells and organic solvent, accelerating lipid diffusion and increasing lipid yield. Lipid extraction from Synechococcus Elongatus, for example, into hexane obtains yields similar to the performance of Bligh and Dyer methods using stronger chloroform and methanol solvent cocktails but much faster. Lipid yield does not vary significantly with the concentration of algae feedstock in the tested algae concentration range, implying that algae culture may be used directly as feedstock to CIJMs without intervening dewatering steps. Algal biocrude obtained from CIJMs converts successfully into biodiesel, and cascades of CIJMs increase the net lipid production. CIJMs provide fast lipid extraction, suggesting compelling opportunities to use CIJMs for extraction generally. © 2018 The Authors

To improve overall performance, combustion and reduced emission characteristics of the engine, the combustion chamber was varied with 5 different geometries. Experimental results revealed that Toroidal re-entrant combustion chamber had higher Exhaust Gas Temperature and Brake Thermal Efficiency by 20.75% and 6.37% than that of HCC, while Brake Specific Fuel Consumption was reduced by 4.49% at optimal loading condition. However, engine overall performance of TrCC was found to be comparable with Hemi-spherical chamber and other designed combustion chambers. Similarly, comparing exhaust emissions, Oxide of Nitrogen and Carbon dioxide were on its higher side by 19.90% and 27.20% than normal HCC. On the contrary, carbon monoxide, Hydrocarbon and Smoke opacity for TrCC were found to be 76.12%, 33.71% and 38.67% lower than HCC. From the above study, it is finally concluded that converted renewable fuels with TrCC might be utilized as an alternative fuel without any exhaust related problems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - There is a need to explore environment friendly fuels and its' performance for the internal combustion engine due to growing consumption of fossil fuel which is contributing in increasing the air pollution levels of earth atmosphere. The purpose of the study is to optimize the factors which are responsible for the performance of engine as well as emission analysis in case of cassia tora biodiesel blends in direct injection diesel engine using RSM optimization technique. Four input parameters have been considered for the present analysis which includes engine load, injection timing, injection pressure, and blend percentage to optimize engine's performance and emission characteristics. This study includes all factors having five codded levels. RSM is used to get optimum amalgamation of the above stated factors to optimize output variables (UHC, BTE, and NOx). Hence, cassia tora biodiesel may leads in achieving better environmental performance with improved commercial value. The experimental design used in the study is based on central composite rotating design (CCRD) matrix. The best combination of input parameters is recorded at 15 obTDC injection timing of fuel, 221 bar injection pressure of fuel, 40% mixing of cassia tora with diesel, and 47% engine load which results in maximum BTE and minimum UHC and NOx emissions of the engine. Experimental and optimized results of the output responses at optimum input parameters are compared and found to be in the suggested error range. From the future point of view, same work can be extended by utilizing the same biodiesel with some changes in the input parameters and output responses by utilizing the RSM technique and making its comparison with other techniques. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, a diesel engine was modified to operate in dual fuel mode with natural gas as the main fuel and a novel fuel mixture of biodiesel and glycerol triacetate additive as pilot fuel. Regarding to experimental tests results, engine emissions were modeled using a combination of artificial neural network and genetic algorithm to determine the appropriate ratio of pilot fuel to gaseous fuel, biodiesel and additive to reduce engine emissions. The algorithm inputs were engine torque, pilot fuel and natural gas consumption, biodiesel and additive proportions in pilot fuel, while outputs were exhaust emissions including NOx, PM, CO, and UHC. Overall, the results of the modeling were consistent well with experimental data. Simulations were performed for a variety of biodiesel and additive compositions and it was accordingly concluded that by using biodiesel and additive, NOx and CO emissions were reduced by up to 63% and 42%, respectively, while PM was reduced substantially by 27 times in comparison with neat diesel fuel in the diesel operation mode. In the dual fuel mode, 24% reduction in NOx emission. However, under these circumstances, UHC emission was 10% higher than that of the diesel operation mode. © 2018

AB  - This study paves the way on reducing smoke emission and NOx emissions of research diesel engine by detailing the effect of water addition in biodiesel. Fuel samples were prepared with different concentrations of water in orange peel oil biodiesel (94% waste orange peel oil biodiesel + 4% water + 2% Span 80 (WOPOBDE1) and 90% waste orange peel oil biodiesel + 8% water + 2% Span 80 (WOPOBDE2). Span 80 was employed as a nonionic surfactant, which emulsifies water in biodiesel. Experimental results revealed that the nitrogen oxides and smoke emission of orange peel oil biodiesel emulsion were reduced by 11%–19% and 3%–21%, respectively, compared to that of neat orange peel oil biodiesel (WOPOBD). In addition, the introduction of orange peel oil–water emulsions in the diesel engine considerably reduced the emissions of unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. The overall hydrocarbon emission of WOPOBDE2 was 12.2% lower than that of WOPOBD and 16.3% lower than that of diesel. The overall CO emission of WOPOBDE2 was 17% lower than that of base fuel (WOPOBD) and 21.8% lower than that of diesel. Experimental results revealed that modified fuel had higher brake thermal efficiency and lower brake specific fuel consumption than that of base fuel at all engine brake power levels. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - In this study, co-liquefaction (HTL) of Prosopis juliflora (PJ) biomass with polyolefin waste (PO) was performed to produce bio-oil. HTL on bio-oil yield was studied at varying PJ to PO ratios (0:1, 1:0, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1 and 5:1) and temperatures from 340 to 440 °C. Bio-oil and HTL by-products were characterized by Mass Spectroscopy (GC–MS) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. Bio-oil yield was around 61.23%wt at 420 °C for 3:1 blends with 3 wt% of HCl activated bentonite catalyst at 60 min holding time. HHV value was 46 MJ/Kg with 88.23% purity (petro-diesel). Additionally gas possessed 26.28% of Hydrogen gas, 45.59% of Carbon dioxide gas, 7.1% of Carbon monoxide gas, 8.12% of Methane gas and other elements. The energy recovery (78%) and carbon recovery (94%) was higher for 3:1 blends bio-oil than PO and PJ processed bio-oils. HTL wastewater possessed higher degree of reusability nature as HTL medium. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work investigated the optimization of process parameters in the upgrading of the oil extracted from Scenedesmus obliquus microalgae using a novel nickel-impregnated biochar catalyst. The effects of temperature, dodecane-to-oil mass ratio and pressure on the upgraded liquid-phase biofuel yield were evaluated and optimized by central composite design of the response surface methodology (RSM). The model equation generated from RSM showed that dodecane-to-oil mass ratio and pressure, as well as the quadratic effects of all the three factors, were significant model terms in predicting the yield of upgraded liquid-phase biofuel. Maximum liquid biofuel yield was attained at 246.89 °C, 3.72 (w/w) dodecane-to-oil mass ratio, 3.84 MPa hydrogen pressure and 6 h processing time. Validation runs resulted in an upgraded biofuel yield of 69.4%, which was in close agreement with predicted values generated by RSM. The upgraded biofuel comprised of 100% green liquid hydrocarbons containing 94% alkanes and 6% alkenes. Its main fuel properties, such as heating value (43.78 MJ kg−1), elemental composition, density, and viscosity, exceeded those of the fatty acid methyl ester standard and were found comparable to those of petroleum diesel. More importantly, the results of the ultimate analysis and confirmed by the findings from Fourier transform infrared and gas chromatography – mass spectroscopy analyses, showed significantly low oxygen and nitrogen content and absence of sulfur in the upgraded biofuel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In tropical countries, the use of fossil fuels and wood to obtain energy is the main option. To preserve natural habitats in this biome, the seeds gathered from wild and cultivated plants, native to this area, could be used for biodiesel production to satisfy the energy demand. For this, the fatty acid profiles of seed oils from 71 species belonging to 28 plant families, all native of tropical regions, were surveyed in a search for carbon-based fuels substitutes. Empirical data obtained from the fatty acid composition of seed oils, as well as lab data obtained from seed oils, were used to assess biodiesel properties, and good correlation between the two methodologies was found. The saponification number, iodine value, cetane number, higher heating value, cold filter-plugging point, density, induction period, and kinematic viscosity were used to establish the suitability of the different seed oils for biodiesel production. The aptness to serve as biodiesel was determined by applying the specification for biodiesel standard made by several organizations. Twenty-seven species have been detected as complying with the most restrictive standards established for quality of biodiesel, which contain enough oil in the seeds as to be considered promising choices for biodiesel production. Actions for promoting the growth of selected species in tropical habitats, in addition to providing a valuable resource as is biodiesel, will improve such areas as adequate habitats for wildlife, while this action would create employment in rural areas using natural resources. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel is a renewable fuel, thus is a sustainable option to minimize the environmental impacts of burning fossil fuels. However, biodiesel may suffer oxidative processes and is necessary to add antioxidants in it. In this study, macerated barley waste and Moringa oleifera leaves were used as antioxidants sources for biodiesel (soybean oil methyl ester). Accelerated oxidations studies, using 32 experimental design and employing the equipment Rancimat®, were made and the best induction time found was 8.18 ± 0.18 h, to concentrations of 13 and 9 g L−1 of waste and leaves, respectively. It was also established that oxidation kinetics follows a zero-order reaction (k = 7.28 × 10-7 cm μS−1 s−1), with an activation energy of 242.1 kJ mol−1. Besides, at 25 °C the biodiesel produced under these conditions can be stored for about 6.5 months without quality losses due to oxidative processes. Thus, it is possible to use barley waste and moringa leaves as antioxidant sources for biodiesel. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The biodiesel production has led to a drastic surplus of glycerol and catalytic conversion of glycerol into value-added products is of great industrial importance. Thus, the acetalization of glycerol with ketone or aldehydes allows the glycerol transformation into bio–additive fuels. In this work, metals-containing vanadium oxides nanotubes (MeVOx NT in which, Me = Co, Pt or Ni) have been synthesized with additional internal porosity and tested in the acetalization of glycerol with acetone (AG) for valuable biofuels production. The catalysts showed remarkable performances in the AG reaction. Furthermore, by variation of the composition, catalyst loading and temperature and using distinct substrates (butyraldehyde, furfuraldehyde and benzaldehyde), NiVOxNT is active, being very selective to solketal and reciclable for 4 times in the AG reaction. On the contrary, pure VOx NT easily deactivated due to the structure agent removal during the reaction, which promote the collapse of the tubular structure. The CoVOxNT and PtVOxNT catalysts did not exhibit such a stable structure and easily deactivated in the reaction due to leaching of the metals oxides during the AG. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - An accurate one parameter correlation for estimating higher heating value (HHV) as a function of the mass fraction of oxygen consumed by combustion is presented. In its derivation, a theoretical and quantitative approach based on the reduction/oxidation half-reactions of the combustion reaction is used. The derivation relates HHV to changes in bond dissociation enthalpies with respect to the oxygen species and fuel elements. HHV is found to be a strong proportional function of changes in bond enthalpies with respect to the oxygen species compared to the other fuel elements, and may be described simply as Δch°HHV=-13.87mO2-Δhvap (MJkg-1), where mO2 is the mass of oxygen required for combustion per 1kg of fuel. The constant is a simplification of a modifier function μDH=-13.87e-0.092xO2 (MJkg-1) (being a function of the mass fraction of oxygen consumption only) that is used to reduce the complexity of the theoretical equation describing the heat of combustion. This yields a correlation for the heat of combustion Δch°HHV=μDHmO2-Δhvap (MJkg-1), which may also be expressed as Δch°HHV=[Formula presented]μDH-Δhvap (MJkg-1). Using 1087 fuel combustion data of wide chemical composition based on the chemical formula of CvCHvHOvONvNSvSPvP, the resulting correlation is shown to perform well statistically, with R2=0.98, RMSE=1.5MJkg-1, and MBE=0.0%. Applying the proposed correlation, HHV was found to be much more sensitive to changes in oxygen content in the fuel than for similar changes in carbon and hydrogen content. Energy quality of fuels, especially in the production of biofuels that make use of highly oxygenated feedstock, should therefore rely on reducing oxygen content in the fuel via deoxygenation pathways such as decarboxylation and decarbonylation while avoiding routes that sacrifice hydrogen (such as hydrodeoxygenation and dehydrogenation). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Direct combustion of biomass is considered the most effective and simple means to contribute to CO2 reduction. In this context, the life-cycle potential of microalgal solid fuel, which has been overlooked so far, was comprehensively scrutinized ranging from cultivation to direct combustion. According to the quantitative data, using the raw fuel was confirmed to offer great benefits over the conventional lipid-targeted microalgal fuel systems through exploiting all of the biomass’ energy potential, thereby being able to significantly increase the energy yield from biomass. The solid fuel is shown to exhibit diverse positive aspects owing to its remarkable calorific value, productivity and CO2 fixation ability. The combustion test reveals coal-microalgae co-combustion brings beneficial consequences on combustibility and environmental impacts with no notable thermal efficiency drop. This holistic appraisal shows microalgae patently possess high potential as a direct combustion fuel, even outperforming that of extensively used woody fuels. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The study was conducted on a partially stabilized zirconia coated single cylinder, four stroke, water cooled and direct injection diesel engine and was modified to use the liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as the primary fuel and pilot spray of biodiesel with and without Di-Tertiary Butyl Peroxide (DTBP) additive as the secondary fuel. The primary fuel was mixed with air in intake manifold, compressed, and ignited by a pilot spray of secondary fuel. The biodiesel was prepared from palm oil by base catalyst transesterification method. The performance and emission characteristics of coated diesel engine were examined by operating on dual fuel mode (LPG-biodiesel and LPG-diesel) without additive and LPG- biodiesel with additive. The results were compared to uncoated engine running on diesel fuel. The study reveal that, a significant improvement in performance of coated engine operating on dual fuel mode (LPG-biodiesel) with additive by an increase in efficiency of 4.5% and decrease in brake specific fuel consumption of 4.2% at 80% of full load, HC and CO emissions are reduced between 9% and 12% at entire load spectrum compared to uncoated engine operating on diesel fuel. NOx emission is drastically reduced up to 32% for dual fuel with additive compared to without additive in coated engine operation and very close to diesel fuel in uncoated engine operation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biofuels are viewed as the answer to safeguard the currently challenged energy security. To this end, the present study provides a comparison between approaches regarding microalgal biomass conversion to bioenergy, with a view on sustainable implementation. The energetic valorization of Chlorella vulgaris biomass cultivated under heterotrophic, sulfur-limited conditions was investigated through the biofuels biodiesel, biogas (biomethane) and combustible dry biomass. The lipid productivity can reach the value of 442.9 ± 6.5 mg L−1 d−1 containing suitable fatty acids for biodiesel production. Next, biochemical methane potential (BMP) assays yielded 360.9 ± 20.2 mL CH4 g VS−1added under mesophilic conditions, while the calorific value of dry C. vulgaris biomass was measured as 24,538 ± 182 kJ kgDW−1 (5,865 ± 43 kcal kgDW−1). Considering the downstream processing required in each approach, the most promising energy valorization method is anaerobic digestion able to reach values up to 20,862 kJ Lreactor−1 day−1 in continuous systems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The potential application of partially distilled alcohol biofuels in a new, advanced, low temperature combustion (LTC) concept called Thermally Stratified Compression Ignition (TSCI) was studied in this work. TSCI, which was recently conceived, attempts to intentionally stratify the temperature distribution in the cylinder prior to ignition in a lean, premixed, compression-ignited combustion mode. Preliminary experiments used the latent heat of vaporization from the direct injection of water to stratify the temperatures prior to ignition and therefore provide control over the start and rate of combustion in LTC and expand the operating range. While these preliminary results are very encouraging, the requirement of a separate direct injector for water somewhat limits the commercial applications of this variant of TSCI (i.e. employing direct water injection). Instead, this work investigates using the latent heat of vaporization of wet ethanol to introduce the forced thermal stratification of TSCI to control the combustion process. A 3D CFD model was implemented and validated in CONVERGE with the SAGE detailed chemistry solver. This model was then used to simulate TSCI with wet ethanol employing a split injection strategy. The results indicate that TSCI with split direct injection of wet ethanol has an overall lower heat release rate and longer burn duration compared to HCCI due to the higher level of thermal stratification prior to ignition achieved through the evaporative cooling effect of the wet ethanol and its high latent heat of vaporization. Additionally, the ethanol/water blend ratio was varied to observe its effect on TSCI combustion. The results show that a higher percentage of water reduces the peak heat release rate and elongates combustion. Finally, different split injection mass fractions were simulated and the results indicated that injecting a higher mass fraction of wet ethanol in the second injection reduces the peak heat release rates and can increase the burn duration up to 68.8%. This way, TSCI with wet ethanol provides cycle-cycle control over the combustion process through adjusting the mass fraction of the first and second injection without requiring any engine hardware changes. © 2018

AB  - Wildfires are getting extreme and more frequent because of increased fuel loads in the forest and extended dry conditions. Prevention of wildfire by fuel treatment methods will generate forest residues in large volumes, which in addition to available logging residues, can be used to produce biofuels and bioproducts. In this study, the techno-economic assessment of three portable systems to produce woodchips briquettes (WCB), torrefied-woodchips briquettes (TWCB) and biochar from forest residues were evaluated using pilot-scale experimental data. A discounted cash flow rate of return method was used to estimate minimum selling prices (MSPs) for each product, to conduct sensitivity analyses, and to identify potential cost-reduction strategies. Using a before-finance-and-tax 16.5% nominal required return on investment, and a mean transport distance of 200 km, the estimated delivered MSPs per oven-dry metric ton (ODMT) of WCB, TWCB, and biochar were $162, $274, and $1044 respectively. The capital investment (16–30%), labor cost (23–28%), and feedstock cost (10–13%) without stumpage cost were the major factors influencing the MSP of solid biofuels and biochar. However, the MSPs of WCB, TWCB, and biochar could be reduced to $65, $145, and $470/ODMT respectively with technologically improved portable systems. In addition, the MSPs of solid biofuels and biochar could be further reduced by renewable energy and carbon credits, if the greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction potentials are quantified and remunerated. In conclusion, portable systems could be economically feasible to use forest residues and make useful products at current market prices while simultaneously reducing potential wildfires and GHG emissions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The fundamental research on ignition and combustion characteristics of a new blended fuel (diesel/Hydrogenated Catalytic Biodiesel) was investigated in a constant volume combustion chamber. The ignition delay, initial ignition position and flame lift-off length were researched via natural flame imaging and broadband chemiluminescence under various ambient temperatures and oxygen concentrations. After that, the emissions characteristics of diesel and blending fuel of B20 were compared in a four-cylinder direct injection diesel engine. Results show that the ignition delay and flame lift-off length decrease with increasing blend ratio of Hydrogenated Catalytic Biodiesel in diesel fuel blends. The gap of flame lift-off length caused by different blend ratios became narrow when Hydrogenated Catalytic Biodiesel exceeds 20% under different oxygen concentrations indicating the effect of chemical properties of fuel on flame lift-off length is declining. Furthermore, the blending fuel of B20 has lower PM emission compared with pure diesel while fuel economy is quite similar. © 2018

AB  - Three-step continuous process for producing biodiesel from palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) was optimized by response surface methodology (RSM). PFAD has high content of free fatty acids (FFA) and is not suited for human consumption: normally it is used in soap or in animal feed. The key parts of the three-step continuous process took place in helical static mixers (HSMs) used as continuous reactors. The three-step process was optimized by RSM with 5 levels for each of three factors in central composite design (CCD). First step was esterification, then second step was esterification, and third was transesterification. Methyl ester purities of 71.01 wt.% from first step, 95.94 wt.% from second step, and 99.96 wt.% from third step were achieved with total chemical consumption of (115.1 wt.% MeOH, 13.5 wt.% H2SO4, and 5.0 g/L KOH), and total residence time 147 s in the 3 HSMs. In continuous processing the maximum yields were 109.5 wt.% first-esterified oil, 117.0 wt.% second-esterified oil, and 129.0 wt.% crude biodiesel, and purified biodiesel 86.4 wt.%, in the separated phases from first, second, and third steps, and after purification, respectively. Ester purity from three-step process meets the standard specifications for commercial biodiesel in Thailand, US, and Europe. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper focuses on the potential impact of various options for decarbonization of public bus transport in Stockholm, with particular attention to electrification. An optimization model is used to locate electric bus chargers and to estimate the associated carbon emissions, using a life cycle perspective and various implementation scenarios. Emissions associated with fuels and batteries of electric powertrains are considered to be the two main factors affecting carbon emissions. The results show that, although higher battery capacities could help electrify more routes of the city's bus network, this does not necessarily lead to a reduction of the total emissions. The results show the lowest life cycle emissions occurring when electric buses use batteries with a capacity of 120 kWh. The fuel choices significantly influence the environmental impact of a bus network. For example, the use of electricity is a better choice than first generation biofuels from a carbon emission perspective. However, the use of second-generation biofuels, such as Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO), can directly compete with the Nordic electricity mix. Among all fuel options, certified renewable electricity has the lowest impact. The analysis also shows that electrification could be beneficial for reduction of local pollutants in the Stockholm inner city; however, the local emissions of public transport are much lower than emissions from private transport. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper presented experimental results to evaluate the optimization of production parameters through response surface methodology. These parameters significantly affected the yield of cottonseed oil methyl ester (COME). The input variables for the production of methyl ester from cottonseed oil were methanol/oil molar ratio, concentration of catalyst, temperature, and stirring speed. The response or output variable was the yield of methyl ester. The fatty acid methyl ester composition of COME (biodiesel) was obtained using a gas chromatography (GC) analyzer. BS EN 14103:2011 was the standard used to analyze the fatty acid methyl ester. The derived mathematical model was statistically accurate to predict the optimum value of COME. The optimized values to obtain a 98.3% yield of methyl ester were as follows: methanol/oil molar ratio of 6:1, catalyst concentration of 0.97% (w/w), temperature of 63.8 °C, and speed of 797 rpm. The physicochemical properties of COME were measured in accordance with ASTM D6751. The friction and wear properties of COME and its blends with petroleum diesel were tested using a four-ball wear testing machine. The tribological characteristics of COME as a new biofuel were assessed. COME displayed good lubricity with a low coefficient of friction and wear scar diameter. The coefficient of friction of pure COME (COME100) was lower than that of pure petroleum diesel (DL100) and COME blends with petrol diesel (COME10, COME20, and COME50). The average coefficient of friction of COME 100 was lower than that of DL100, COME10, COME20, and COME50 by 28.06%, 19.49%, 7.49%, and 3.65%, respectively. The wear scar diameter of COME100 for the tested ball was lower than that of DL100, COME10, COME20, and COME50 by 47.6%, 33.3%, 32.1%, and 21.42%, respectively. The worn surfaces of the tested balls were examined by scanning electron microscopy, and the results were presented in this paper. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Increased production and use of renewable hydrocarbons has created a need for accurate quantification of the biobased carbon content of hydrocarbon fuels. The blend percentages of conventional biofuels (such as biodiesel and ethanol) can be quantified by numerous methods such as gas chromatography and infrared spectroscopy. Distinguishing the biobased content of a purely hydrocarbon fuel, however, is more difficult. In this study, a single-blind trial was conducted to assess the accuracy and precision of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon analysis of the biobased carbon content of hydrocarbon fuels. Test samples with known biobased carbon contents ranging from 0 to 10 wt% were sent to four labs for analysis by ASTM D6866-16 Method B. Blank correction of the test results was found to improve measurement accuracy through the reduction of lab-specific systematic error. Favorable precision, accuracy, and a limit of detection were determined. This study strongly supports radiocarbon analysis by AMS as an accurate and reliable method for quantifying the biobased carbon content of hydrocarbon transportation fuels. © 2018 The Author(s)

AB  - Sludge contains numerous organic matters that benefit the production of fuels. In this study, the effects of different pretreatments on the hydrothermal liquefaction of sludge were investigated. The results showed that the release of bound water from sludge promoted liquefaction reactions at lower temperatures and inhibited the macromolecular chain-breaking into low-molecular compounds at higher temperatures. Compared with bio-oil from the raw sludge, the nitrogen content in the bio-oil was reduced from 6.1% to 2.9% after subcritical water (SCW) pretreatment. The calorific value of the bio-oil increased from 32.2 MJ/kg to 35.2 MJ/kg after cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) pretreatment. The alcohol content in the bio-oil increased eight fold, and the contents of hydrocarbons and their derivatives increased by 11.5 times after fatty alcohol polyoxyethylene ether (AEO9) pretreatment. CTAB–AEO9 could promote various reactions (e.g., nucleophilic, elimination, and oxidation), but the transesterification reaction dominated. CTAB–AEO9–SCW pretreatment increased the oil yield one fold and reduced the acid content by 95.2%. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Advocacy for climate mitigation aims to minimize the use of fossil fuel and to support clean energy adaptation. While alternative energies (e.g., biofuels) extracted from feedstock (e.g., micro-algae) represent a promising role, their production requires reliably modeled photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). PAR models predict energy parameters (e.g., algal carbon fixation) to aid in decision-making at PAR sites. Here, we model very short-term (5-min scale), sub-tropical region's PAR with an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System model with a Centroid-Mean (ANFIS-CM) trained with a non-climate input (i.e., only the solar angle, θ Z ). Accuracy is benchmarked against genetic programming (GP), M5Tree, Random Forest (RF), and multiple linear regression (MLR). ANFIS-CM integrates fuzzy and neural network algorithms, whereas GP adopts an evolutionary approach, M5Tree employs binary decision, RF employs a bootstrapped ensemble, and MLR uses statistical tools to link PAR with θ Z . To design the ANFIS-CM model, 5-min θ Z (01–31 December 2012; 0500H–1900H) for sub-tropical, Toowoomba are utilized to extract predictive features, and the testing accuracy (i.e., differences between measurements and forecasts) is evaluated with correlation (r), root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Willmott (WI), Nash–Sutcliffe (E NS ), and Legates &amp; McCabes (E LM ) Index. ANFIS-CM and GP are equivalent for 5-min forecasts, yielding the lowest RMSE (233.45 and 233.01μ mol m −2 s −1 ) and MAE (186.59 and 186.23 μmol m −2 s −1 ). In contrast, MLR, M5Tree, and RF yields higher RMSE and MAE [(RMSE = 322.25 μmol m −2 s −1 , MAE = 275.32 μmol m −2 s −1 ), (RMSE = 287.70 μmol m −2 s −1 , MAE = 234.78 μmol m −2 s −1 ), and (RMSE = 359.91 μmol m −2 s −1 , MAE = 324.52 μmol m −2 s −1 )]. Based on normalized error, ANFIS-CM is considerably superior (MAE = 17.18% versus 19.78%, 34.37%, 26.39%, and 30.60% for GP, MLR, M5Tree, and RF models, respectively). For hourly forecasts, ANFIS-CM outperforms all other methods (WI = 0.964 vs. 0.942, 0.955, 0.933 &amp; 0.893, and E LM  = 0.741 versus 0.701, 0.728, 0.619 &amp; 0.490 for GP, MLR, M5Tree, and RF, respectively). Descriptive errors support the versatile predictive skills of the ANFIS-CM model and its role in real-time prediction of the photosynthetic-active energy to explore biofuel generation from micro-algae, studying food chains, and supporting agricultural precision. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethoxybiphenyl-4,4′-diol (TMBP) is described in the literature as having antioxidant activity, and can be obtained through enzyme-catalyzed processes. Its use as an additive to biodiesel offers a more sustainable substitute for the antioxidants commonly used for the conservation of this type of biofuel. In this work, TMBP was synthesized from 2,6-dimethoxyphenol catalyzed by the laccase from Botryosphaeria rhodina MAMB-05, and applied to soybean biodiesel to evaluate its antioxidant action by the determination of the induction period, and kinetic and thermodynamic oxidation parameters. Biodiesel samples containing TMBP presented induction periods higher than the 6 h in the Rancimat test conducted at 110 °C. The reaction rate constants at all temperatures examined were lower than those obtained for samples containing tert-butylhydroxytoluene (BHT), a common synthetic antioxidant added to biodiesel. The kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of oxidation indicated the effectiveness of TMBP in the inhibition of oxidative processes in soybean biodiesel compared to BHT. The antioxidant action of TMBP was not impaired as a function of thermal degradation, as thermogravimetry analyzes indicated degradation events occurring only above 270 °C. © 2018

AB  - Laminar burning speed and ignition delay time behavior of iso-octane at the presence of two different biofuels, ethanol and 2,5 dimethyl furan (DMF), was studied in this work. Biofuels are considered as a better alternative source of fossil fuels. There is a potentiality that combustion characteristics of iso-octane can be improved using biofuels as an oxygenated additive. In this study, three different blending ratios of 5%, 25%, and 50% of ethanol/iso-octane and DMF/iso-octane were investigated. For laminar burning speed calculation, equivalence ratio of 0.6-1.4 was considered. Ignition delay time was measured under temperature ranges from 650 K to 1100 K. Two different mechanisms were considered in numerical calculation. These mechanisms were validated by comparing the results of pure fuels with wide range of experimental and numerical data. The characteristic change of iso-octane with the presence of additives was observed by comparing the results with pure fuel. Significant change was observed on behavior of iso-octane at 50% blending ratio. A comparison was also done on the effect of two different additives. It has found that addition of DMF brings significant changes on iso-octane characteristics comparing to ethanol. Copyright © 2019 by ASME.

AB  - The spent bleaching clays (SBC) of vegetable oil refining plants have residual vegetable oil contents ranging from 17 to 40 wt%. The common worldwide practice of landfilling such spent clays imposes inevitable environmental hazards. The extraction of oil from a spent clay will not only alleviate this problem, but can also provide an oil source for processes, such as transesterification for the production of alcohol-esters. In-situ transesterification of the residual oil within SBC is an even more attractive idea, as it can eliminate the extraction step from the process. In this study, in-situ transesterification on the spent bleaching clay of a local vegetable oil plant was investigated experimentally. Furthermore, optimum operating conditions were determined for a number of parameters influencing the conversions, including reaction temperature, ethanol-to-SBC ratio, alkali catalyst type, and catalyst-to-SBC mass ratio. The experiments were designed by the response surface method based on the central composite approach (RSM-CCD model). The results were analyzed using the analysis of variance method (ANOVA) to investigate the effect of the parameters on the efficiencies of the biodiesel produced and the oil removed from the initial SBC. Within the ranges investigated, the maximum conversion to ethyl-ester was 72.90% at the optimum conditions of a reaction temperature of 73.2 °C, reaction time of 4.5 h, ethanol/SBC ratio of 4.2 ml/g, while using NaOH alkali catalyst with a catalyst-to-SBC mass ratio of 4.33%. © 2018

AB  - Bioenergy may have significant lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensities compared to fossil alternatives, but concerns are raised that bioenergy would contribute to additional water scarcity. Therefore, the GHG intensity, water intensity and water-related risks are analysed simultaneously for conventional diesel and soya bean-based biodiesel from Argentina, Brazil, Unites States (U.S.), Thailand and Iran on a life cycle basis. The water-related risks are estimated with a water scarcity—consumption matrix, which was recently developed. Results show that a significant share (9%-38%) of the GHG emissions in all biodiesel cases is caused by soil N 2 O emissions. In addition, the ranges in water consumption intensity for soya bean-based biodiesel are considerably larger than for fossil fuels. However, whether this leads to high water-related risks depends on the local water scarcity. Soya bean-based biodiesel from Argentina has low water-related risks to all nodes of the supply chain due to low local water stress combined with a low direct water consumption intensity (20 L/GJ fuel ). In addition, high GHG emission reduction (71%) and a low-specific eutrophication potential (0.04 kg PO 4 3− /GJ fuel ) are achieved. The indirect water consumption intensity is estimated at 120–420 L/GJ for soya bean-based biodiesel, which is significant if the soya beans are rainfed, like in Argentina and Brazil. If irrigation is required, indirect water consumption is dwarfed by irrigation water. Overall, it is concluded that soya bean-based biodiesel can have significant lower GHG emission intensity than fossil diesel, without causing additional water stress in the supply chain if they are produced in water abundant areas and good agricultural practices are used. The used method shows disaggregated water-related risks for the different nodes of the supply chain to acknowledge the regional nature of water scarcity and enables decision makers to identify “hot spots” and take targeted actions. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Long chain alcohols are potential fuels for engine applications, however, their combustion characteristics need to be adequately investigated compared to short chain alcohols (C1–C4), especially at high mixture temperatures, and other conditions relevant to engine temperatures. In the present work, meso-scale diverging channel method has been used to measure the laminar burning velocity of n-pentanol + air mixtures at elevated temperatures due to existence of very limited data at higher mixture temperatures (∼473 K). The present experiments are carried out at atmospheric pressure with unburnt mixture temperature varying up to 560 K. The dependence of laminar burning velocity on temperature was correlated using the power law: Su=Su,0Tu/Tu,0 α, where α is the temperature exponent. The results show the existence of a minimum value of α for slightly rich mixtures. A reduced kinetic model based on the previous detailed kinetic model of Sarathy (2014) for C1–C5 straight-chain alcohols was generated with 199 species and 1427 reactions. Experimental results of laminar burning velocity of n-pentanol + air mixtures at high temperatures were compared with the present model and other kinetic models from the literature. The skeletal model accurately reproduces the measurements at various conditions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This experimental study investigates the combustion and pollutants emissions from a small scale furnace burning diesel fuel blended with raw jojoba oil. Jojoba oil to diesel proportions in the blends (on mass basis) ranging from 0 to 35% are considered for total blended fuel flow rate of about 8 kg/h. Higher fuel supply rates of about 10 kg/h were needed in order to allow for reaching higher jojoba share in the blends up to about 60%. This allows for securing sufficient amount of the higher volatility component (diesel) whose combustion would support the vaporization and subsequent ignition and combustion of the heavier jojoba oil. The presence of jojoba in the blends leads to a clear reduction in NOx and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions but it showed less impact on CO levels. Due to its high viscosity, jojoba in the blends impacts spray formation hence seems to have an indirect detrimental effect on CO emissions. Moreover, jojoba oil in the blends adversely impact thermal radiation to furnace walls due to less sooting tendency of the flame when jojoba is present. To some extent, this is also attributed to the way jojoba influences spray processes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this research a new process of harvesting the oleaginous yeast biomass (Yarrowia lipolytica) by flocculation followed by cell wall disruption and lipid extraction with petroleum diesel as a solvent was developed. Alum and calcium chloride along with the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) as a flocculant were evaluated for lipid bearing biomass settling. The maximum flocculation activity of biomass using calcium chloride (36 mM) in combination with EPS (5.85 mg EPS/g biomass) or Alum (1.2 mM) with EPS (18 mg EPS/g biomass) was 74.3 and 79% and the settling velocity was 2.93 and 1.46 mm/s, respectively. To have a similar efficiency of biomass settling, 3.07 times less dosage of EPS was required in combination with calcium chloride than required with Alum. Further, settled biomass (166 g/L) was treated with N-lauroyl sarcosine (N-LS) to disrupt the cellular structure and release lipid. The released lipid was separated from cell debris and water using petroleum diesel (co-solvent) and maximum lipid recovery efficiency of 94.7 ± 1.2 % (w/w) was observed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In 2015, the United Nations challenged the scientific community to evaluate development pathways consistent with the goal of limiting global average temperature increase to 1.5 °C. This study reports analysis that was carried out as part of a project responding to that challenge. Using recently developed methods for regional integrated assessment of agricultural systems, this study evaluates the economic and environmental performance of dryland farming systems in the United States of America (U.S). Pacific Northwest, a major wheat (Triticum aestivum) production region, under greenhouse gas mitigation and policy scenarios consistent with the 1.5 °C goal. A novel feature of this study is to combine bio-physical and economic models with site-specific life cycle analysis to evaluate both the economic performance of current and possible alternative farming systems. The analysis shows that these farming systems could be adapted through changes in management to reduce soil emissions of greenhouse gases and incorporation of new biofuel crops, and could be affected by changes in prices and costs of production associated with greenhouse gas mitigation policies. These changes could result in a win-win outcome for those farms in the Pacific Northwest region where site-specific conditions are suited to these adaptations, providing both higher farm incomes and contributing to greenhouse gas emissions reductions. A key implication for mitigation and adaptation strategies is the need to coordinate climate policy design and development of technologies needed to achieve policy goals. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Diesel engine with RCCI (Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition) finds the next generation technology in engine research for combusting slow burning fuels such as vegetable oils and arriving extremely lower levels of smoke and NO (Nitric Oxide) emissions simultaneously. An attempt was made to operate a diesel engine on RCCI mode by injecting ethanol as low reactivity fuel at the intake manifold of the engine using sunflower based Waste Cooking Oil (WCO) as high reactivity fuel under oxygen enriched intake air. The influence of the combined effect of oxygen enrichment and RCCI mode on engine's behavior was studied using WCO as the high reactivity (main) fuel. Significant improvement (upto 33.5% with RCCI mode from 29.1% with neat WCO at peak power) in BTE (brake thermal efficiency) with drastic reduction in smoke (upto 48% with RCCI at the maximum efficiency point from 69% with neat WCO at peak power) and NO were achieved with injection of ethanol under RCCI mode when using WCO as base fuel mainly at high loads (power outputs). Combining oxygen enrichment with RCCI resulted in further improvement in BTE (upto 36.2%) and reduction in smoke (upto 37% at the maximum efficiency point), HC and CO emissions at all power outputs. Peak pressure and energy release rate were found to be superior with RCCI mode with EF (electronic fuel) injection of ethanol associated with oxygen enriched combustion. It is concluded that RCCI operation with injection of ethanol combined with oxygen enrichment could be preferred for very high BTE, lowest smoke and NO emissions using WCO as base fuel. The optimal level of low reactivity fuel blending with high reactivity WCO could be at the ethanol energy share of 25% for the highest thermal efficiency at peak load. The optimal oxygen concentration of 23% by volume could be preferred for best performance of the engine fueled with WCO as main fuel. © 2017

AB  - In this paper, two molecular sieves with different pore sizes, namely HZSM-5 and MCM-41, were mixed using different ratios and used in the in-situ catalytic pyrolysis of rape straw. The effects of different HZSM -5 and MCM -41 mixing ratios on the quality of the bio-oil were studied by physicochemical properties, product yields and compositions. Moreover, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) catalyst analysis was performed. The results showed that the liquid yield and organic phase decreased first and then increased, whereas the gas yield showed an opposite trend. The density, O/C and kinematic viscosity of the bio-oil organic phase decreased first then increased, whereas the H/C, pH values and higher heating values initially increased, then declined. The oxygen content, H/C, O/C, kinematic viscosity, density, higher heating value and pH value of the bio-oil organic phase obtained at 1:1 mixed ratio were 12.81%, 1.701, 0.126, 5.06 mm2/s, 0.94 g/cm3, 34.31 MJ/kg and 5.41, respectively. The organic phase included numerous organic compounds, such as carboxylic acids, aldehydes, ketones, hydrocarbons, alcohols, ethers and esters. The hydrocarbon content in the bio-oil organic phase gradually increased and the carbonyl groups content gradually decreased as the MCM-41 content increased from 0 to 50%. In contrast, the hydrocarbon content gradually decreased and the carbonyl groups content gradually increased as the MCM-41 content increased from 50% to 100%. The hydrocarbon and carbonyl groups contents were 53.83% and 6.35%, respectively, at the MCM-41 content of 50%. The mixed catalyst activity increased with the increase in MCM-41 content (up to 50%), and tended to be stable once the MCM-41 contents surpassed 50%. © 2017 Energy Institute

AB  - Biodiesel and single cell oils obtained from oleaginous yeasts grown in industrial waste are attractive alternatives to the conventional fuels. However, there are only few articles dealing with the stability of the microbial biofuels. Hence, this study aimed at characterizing the storage time of biodiesels using Rancimat methods. The microbial oil and the biodiesel obtained from microbial oil have been characterized with storage stability due to various oxidizing and thermal damage. Here, the microbial fuels were subject to Rancimat analysis and found to have high thermal-oxidative stability of 18 and 8.78 h for biodiesel and oil, respectively. The storage stability resulting from storage conditions was extrapolated for biodiesel and oil and has been found to be 1.62 and 0.54 years, respectively. The infrared spectroscopic analysis reveals the degree of oxidation found after the induction time was reached and shows the characteristic peaks for degradation products. Gas chromatography revealed the compounds that were responsible for the stability as well as the amount of degradation products left. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The present work studies the effect of butanol in thumba (Citrullus colocynthis) biodiesel in an IDI CI engine at varying percentages of 5 and 10% in 15 and 10% thumba biodiesel respectively with 80% diesel in each blend. Another blend was introduced with 80% diesel and 20% biodiesel without any additive. The experiment was conducted in a single cylinder four-stroke IDI CI engine at 1500 rpm varying from 25% to full-load (100%) conditions. The results showed diesel with less bio diesel and higher butanol in percentage gives good performance and emission compared to diesel at higher loads. Blend containing 10% bio diesel, 10% butanol, and 80% diesel (D80B10Bu10) showed higher cylinder pressure, heat release rate, BThE, and less NO x . Biodiesels gave less UHC, CO emissions. In this work, multi-objective fuzzy-based genetic algorithm was introduced for the best fit result. Four parameters were used for optimization (BSFC, BThE, CO, NO x ). The result from genetic algorithm was taken for validation and the optimized result was found adequate after validation. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The transesterification of sunflower oil with methanol, using immobilized lipase enzymes as catalysts, was studied. The process was carried out in a semi-continuous mode. Temperature (30–50 °C), methanol flow (0.024–0.04 ml/min), kind of enzyme (Lipozyme 62350, Lipozyme TL-IM, Novozym 435 and Pseudomonas cepacia Sol–Gel-AK) and enzyme concentrations (1.25–10% by weight) were the operating variables. The final product was characterized by the EN 14214 standard. All the parameters, except for cold filter plugging point, were similar to a diesel fuel. For low methanol flows, reaction rate was proportional to methanol concentration. High flows caused catalyst deactivation. Novozyme 435, Lipozyme TL-IM and Lipozyme 62350 showed similar maximum reaction rates, but Novozyme 435 was more resistant to deactivation. Pseudomonas cepacia hardly obtained 1% conversion. The catalyst concentration, up to 2.5%, had a positive effect on the reaction rate and conversion. The optimum temperature was 40 °C. The initial reaction rate was in line with the Arrhenius law, up to 50 °C. By differential and integral methods, the Michaelis–Menten, competitive inhibition and ping-pong bi–bi kinetic parameters were determined. The transesterification of sunflower oil in a semi-continuous regime of alcohol improved the results, compared to the discontinuous regime, and those were similar to the obtained ones in a discontinuous regime with step-by-step methanol addition. The lipase that showed the best yield and higher resistance to deactivation was Novozym 435. The kinetic models that forecast the deactivation of lipases by an inhibitor described the experimental behavior properly. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The present work reports covalent immobilization of steapsin lipase (SL) on Immobead-350 support matrix (IMB) to make a robust biocatalytic system to work under supercritical carbon dioxide condition (Sc-CO 2 ). The developed biocatalyst (IMB:SL) was characterized in details and utilized to convert waste cooking sunflower oil (WCSO) into value-added energy chemical (biodiesel) in Sc-CO 2 . All reaction process parameters were optimized in detail which offered 86.33% yield of biodiesel from WCSO. The developed Sc-CO 2 protocol is compared with the solvent-free conventional synthesis, which indicates almost twofold higher yield of biodiesel in Sc-CO 2 media as compared to solvent-free condition. To extend the scope, we have tested fresh and waste cooking oils (WCO) from various sources, offering 81–94% yield of biodiesel. The biocatalyst activity was investigated in various parameters of supercritical condition to know the biocatalyst stability in Sc-CO 2 . Besides this, IMB:SL biocatalyst was effectively reused up to five recycle. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Purpose: Biodiesel is a renewable fuel that can be mixed with toluene and be accidentally released into anoxic ecosystems and impact soil microbial communities. Therefore, the aim of the present work was to examine, under nitrate-reduction conditions, the biodegradation of toluene in the presence of two different types of biodiesel (sunflower and rapeseed), and their impact on the bacterial community structure. Materials and methods: Sediment samples were spiked individually with toluene, biodiesel, and their blends in laboratory-designed microcosms. Sunflower oil biodiesel was produced in the laboratory, while rapeseed oil biodiesel was a commercial product. Degradation of biodiesels and blends was monitored by directly measuring the substrate or indirectly by determining nitrate removal during the course of the experiment. Denitrification rates were estimated with the acetylene inhibition technique. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to assess impacts on the bacterial community structure exposed to biodiesels, blends, and toluene. Results and discussion: The results of this study showed that toluene and biodiesel were completely degraded within 10 days. Biodiesel significantly affected the bacterial community structure at a similar magnitude, independently of its origin. Additionally, toluene impacted the bacterial community and denitrification process to a lower extent than biodiesel and a clear decrease in the relative bacterial richness and diversity was shown in samples with biodiesel and blends. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first reports describing degradation of biodiesel alone and blends under nitrate-reducing conditions, and also the effects of these compounds on the denitrification process. In addition, due to the recently discovered “oxygenic denitrification” process, the acetylene inhibition technique and nitrous oxide quantification may not be the most adequate tool to estimate denitrification rates. Further detailed studies are advised to understand whether the identified bacterial community shift impacts ecosystem functions. Conclusions: Our results help to understand the biodegradation of toluene, biodiesel, and their blends in sediments under nitrate-reducing conditions and might be important in implementing bioremediation strategies in anoxic environments. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - To deal with the corrosive property of bio-oil, laser-induced coatings were synthesized on the typical cylinder liner rubbing surfaces. Two nano-additives including MoS2 nanosheets and graphene were introduced into the coatings. The tribological performances of the coated surfaces were tested on a multifunctional cylinder liner-piston ring tribometer. The surfaces before and after sliding were characterized with modern surface analysis technology including Raman spectra, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and etc. The results show that the nickel-based coated surfaces can effectively prevent the corrosion of the bio-oil. In addition, the laser-induced coatings had better antifriction and antiwear performances than the corresponding traditional electroless plating coatings. With the introduction of MoS2 nanosheets or graphene, the tribological performances of the coatings were further enhanced. Laser irradiation increased the concentration of the nano-additives in the coatings and the thickness of the tribo-layers, which accounted for their outstanding tribological performances. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Three isostructural zirconium-based metal organic frameworks (MOFs), UiO-66, UiO-66(COOH)2 and UiO-66(NH2) were synthesized, fully characterized and efficiently used as active and recyclable catalysts for the esterification reaction of butyric acid to produce a green fuel additive, butyl butyrate. The catalytic activities of the used structures were comparable, and mostly better, than other heterogeneous acid catalyst reported in the literature. Moreover, 90% conversion was achieved by employing the most acidic member, UiO-66(COOH)2, which is close to the 95% conversion obtained by the conventional liquid catalyst H2SO4. Using the synthesized MOFs, large variations in the conversion to butyl butyrate were obtained which was the base of a detailed investigation on the origin of their catalytic activities. The analysis of the TGA results helped estimate the number of structural defects in each studied MOF. Interestingly, it was concluded that, for the MOFs with different organic linkers, the catalytic activity was not directly related to the number of defects. Further analysis was done to investigate the alternative parameters that could be behind this difference in catalytic activity, and the parameters included but were not limited to the surface area of the MOFs, their particle size, the linkers’ active sites, and their accessibility through effective mass transfer. Although a combination of these factors were found to contribute to the superior catalytic activity of UiO-66(COOH)2, however, its exceptional conversion was mainly attributed to the effect of the additional active acid functional groups grafted onto its organic linker, along with its smaller particle size which allowed for better mass transfer and accessibility of the active site Furthermore, two kinetic models were successfully developed and used to determine the different kinetic parameters of the esterification reaction and to study their dependence on the different characteristics of the MOFs. With this knowledge, catalytic activity of MOFs can be engineered from a laboratory prototype and optimized by tuning the functional groups of the organic linkers to serve as effective catalysts for the production of fine chemicals such as biofuels. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The conversion of lignin to biofuels and biobased chemicals is currently attracting a lot of attention. We here report on the valorization of Kraft lignin by a catalytic hydrotreatment using Ni, Mo, and W phosphide catalysts supported on activated carbon in the absence of an external solvent. Experiments were carried out in a batch setup in the temperature range of 400-500 °C and 100 bar initial H 2 pressure. The synthesized catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, nitrogen physisorption, and transmission electron microscopy. The lignin oils were analyzed extensively by different techniques such as GPC, GC-MS-FID, 13 C NMR, and elemental analysis. Two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC×GC-FID) was applied to identify and quantify distinct groups of compounds (aromatics, alkylphenolics, alkanes, etc.). Mo-based catalysts displayed higher activity compared to the W-containing catalysts. The reaction parameters such as the effect of reaction temperature, reaction time, and catalyst loading were studied for two catalysts (15MoP/AC and 20NiMoP/AC), and optimized reaction conditions regarding yields of monomeric components were identified (400 °C, 100 bar H 2 at RT, 10 wt % catalyst loading on lignin intake). The highest monomer yield (45.7 wt % on lignin) was obtained for the 20NiMoP/AC (Ni 5.6 wt %, Mo 9.1 wt %, P 5.9 wt %) catalyst, which includes 25% alkylphenolics, 8.7% aromatics, and 9.9% alkanes.

AB  - The importance of developing new alternative sources of energy meets the needs of some industrial sectors, such as rice processing. In Brazil, especially in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, the demand for electric and thermal energy is considerable since the state has more than 50 industries installed in this food sector. On the other hand, throughout the benefit of the rice grain, high amounts of husk are generated, with a capacity to produce synthesis gas. In addition, the treatment of the effluents generated during parboiling is rich in organic matter, which can generate high volumes of biogas through anaerobic treatment. The mixture of these gases can be applied in a spark ignition engines (SI), taking advantage of the bioenergy potential of the rice industries in Brazil. In addition to a renewable source of locally available energy, emissions of polluting gases can also be reduced. Accordingly, in this work, it was used the spark-ignition engine test operating with typical biogas and syngas compositions generated in the rice industries and their mixture, named Bio75 (included 75% of methane by vol.), syngas (with composition by vol. H2 = 18.5%, CO = 26.5% CH4 = 1.8%, CO2 = 12.5%, N2 = 40.7%), Blend 1 (included 15% of Bio75 and 85% of Syngas), Blend 2 (included 50% of Bio75 and 50% of Syngas), respectively. An important result that could be observed was that for both biogas and biogas-syngas mixture fuel the increase in excess ratio (λ) value from 1 to 1.25 leads to lower CO and NOx emissions as well as an increase in indicated efficiency. Using fuel mix, even at low concentration, such as 15% by vol., Bio75 provided edv increase of 6.5% in the Blend 1. When the content of Bio75 in the mixture reach 50% (Blend 2) the increase of edv exceeds 14.5%. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Highly phenol substituted bio-oil–phenol–formaldehyde (BPF) adhesives were prepared via the phenolization-copolymerization method, in which furfural was used as a novel crosslinking agent to improve the bonding performance. The effects of bio-oil percentage, furfural content, curing temperature, and pressure on the performance of BPF adhesives have been studied in detail. A BPF adhesive with 75% bio-oil percentage and 15% furfural loading (named 75BPF_15) was synthesized, which was cured at 180 °C and 4 MPa. Compared to the conventional phenol–formaldehyde adhesive, the wet tensile strength of 75BPF_15 adhesive reached 2.84 MPa, which was significantly higher than the 1.54 MPa of PF. A possible mechanism of BPF adhesives crosslinked with furfural is proposed. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2019, 136, 46995. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - In this paper, the discrete phase model (DPM) was introduced to study the fuel injector cavitations process and the macro spray characteristic of three different types of nozzle spray shape with diesel and hybrid biofuel blend for several injection pressures and backpressures. The three types of nozzle spray shapes used were circle, elliptical A type, and elliptical B type. The cavitations’ flows inside the injector nozzles were simulated with Computer Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations using the cavitations mixture approach. The effect of nozzle spray shape towards the spray characteristic of hybrid biofuel blends is analyzed and compared with the standard diesel. Furthermore, a verification and validation from both the experimental results and numerical results are also presented. The nozzle flow simulation results indicated that the fuel type did not affect the cavitation area vastly, but were more dependent on the nozzle spray shape. In addition, the spray width of the elliptical nozzle shape was higher as compared to the circular spray. Moreover, as the backpressure increased, the spray width downstream increased as well. The spray tip penetration for the elliptical nozzle shape was shorter than the circular nozzle shape due to circular nozzles having smaller nozzle widths and lesser spray cone angles. Thus, this resulted in smaller aerodynamic drag. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - An integrated multistep catalytic process in a one-pot cascade model to realize conversion is preferred in terms of process economics and energy efficiency. Here, we present the noble-metal-free but highly effective catalytic transfer hydrogenation and acid-catalyzed conversion of biomass-derived furfural for direct production of biofuel alkyl levulinate using alcohols as the hydrogen donor and reaction medium. With optimization of the process variables, a high yield of alkyl levulinate at up to 85.3% could be captured under mild conditions in isopropanol medium with the combination of Zr-MCM-41 and Amberlyst-15 catalysts. The reaction proceeds via the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol over Zr-MCM-41, which is then converted to alkyl levulinate by an Amberlyst-15 acid catalyst. The spent hybrid catalysts could be effectively recovered from the resulting reaction mixture and reused 5 times with little deactivation after plain regeneration treatment. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - To promote catalytic performances of Ni-based mesoporous Y (meso-Y) zeolite in the hydrocracking conversion of microalgae biodiesel to jet fuel range hydrocarbons, 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane was utilized as sulfonating agent to improve the acid density of meso-Y zeolite. The physiochemical properties of sulfonated meso-Y zeolite were characterized via temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia, X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and N 2 physisorption. It was detected that sulfonic acid groups (-SO 3 H) composed of S–O and S[dbnd]O bonds were successfully grafted onto meso-Y zeolite framework. The strong acid density significantly increased from 0.31 mmol/g to 1.21 mmol/g when meso-Y zeolite was treated with 0.38 mL/g sulfonating agent. The crystalline interplanar spacing of meso-Y zeolite expanded with a shifted position (2θ) of X-ray diffraction peak from 15.72° to 15.70°. The enhanced hydrocracking capacity of 10% Ni/sulfonated meso-Y zeolite catalyst resulted in improvements in microalgae biodiesel conversion (from 82.1% to 99.7%) and jet fuel range alkane selectivity (from 31.2% to 52.3%). © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Nowadays, the waste generation increases more and more, especially of the municipal solid waste. The municipal solid waste reject fraction may be valorized from an energy point of view. With this aim, a conceptual design of a process was developed by considering material and energy integration, which mainly consists of three sub-processes: fast pyrolysis of municipal solid waste to produce bio-oil, supercritical water reforming of the bio-oil aqueous phase to produce hydrogen to be used in the third section, which is the upgrading of the organic phase of the bio-oil by hydrodeoxygenation. The overall system was simulated using Aspen Plus software to achieve the highest process performance and the lowest utilities requirement. The former was assessed by the biofuel production (liquefied fuel gas, gasoline and diesel) and the net electrical power. In addition, the potential economic profitability of the plant was performed by specifying the main process units. Thus, for a feeding of 50 t/h of municipal solid waste reject fraction, a generation of a net electric power equal to 10.65 MWe and a production of 5.2 t/h biofuels (21.1% of the carbon present in the municipal solid waste) may be achieved, thus obtaining a very low gate fee (16.7 €/t) using the same industrial selling prices that those of fossil fuels and electricity in a full plant. Therefore, the process seems to be technically and economically feasible. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - One prevailing issue for assessing the performance of hydrothermal liquefaction is understanding the role of the extraction solvent used for product separation. This study evaluated the extraction agent's impact on the hydrothermal liquefaction products and energy efficiency. Three representative solvents (acetone, dichloromethane, and toluene) were chosen with three representative high-carbohydrate, protein, and ash content feedstocks (Chlorella sp., Nannochloropsis sp., and Enteromorpha pr., respectively). Extraction of the oil using dichloromethane led to the highest biocrude oil yield (dry biomass) for Chlorella sp. (48.8%), toluene for Nannochloropsis sp. (23.3%), and acetone for Enteromorpha pr. (9.8%). The solvent selection led to a maximum variation of 20.4% for all oil yields. Dichloromethane produced high energy recovery values (maximum: 67.1%) and low energy consumption ratios (minimum: 0.06) regardless of the feedstock chemical composition. Dichloromethane also led to consistently high net energy values and high fossil energy ratios amongst all feedstocks. We speculate that the solvent polarity, chemical structure, hydrogen bonding, and dipole-dipole interactions influenced output parameters by the selective isolation and extraction of the chemical compounds in the biocrude oil. This study suggested that the extraction solvent selection should be carefully considered and normalized for the reporting of hydrothermal liquefaction yields and energy efficiency values. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this research, cylinder liners of a diesel engine were coated with a 150 μm thick Fe2B layer using boronizing method. The upper surface of the piston was coated with a 300 μm thick CoNiCrAlYttra + NiCrBSi layer by using plasma spraying method. D-2, biodiesel (PSME-100) and blend (PSME-50) were used as test fuels. PSME fuel was produced through alkali catalyzed transesterification method. As-prepared fuels were used separately in coated (CE) and standard engines (SE) to compare performance and exhaust emission of both engines. In order to see the isolation effect of Fe2B layer, 3-D finite element transient-state analyses were carried out. According to the results, brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and exhaust gas temperature (EGT) of coated engine were considerably enhanced while brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), CO, HC and smoke emission were decreased compared to those of standard engine. However, NOx emission of CE was higher than that of uncoated one, which was attributed to high combustion temperature and long combustion process in CE. These results were further confirmed with finite element simulation. The decreasing BSFC and increasing BTE for coated engine has been attributed to the elevated temperature of the combustion chamber by the effect of thermal insulation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Aiming towards discovering a solution for the imminent fossil fuel crisis, the research contributes towards the utilisation of orange peel oil as a potential alternative to mineral diesel while strictly adhering to the emission norms. The study reveals the performance, combustion and emissions characteristics obtained upon operating a 20% by volume of OPO blended with diesel, in a compression ignition engine, integrated with a common rail direct injection (CRDi) system. The fuel injection pressures were varied as 400 bar, 500 bar and 600 bar. Furthermore, two stage injection strategies were employed while varying the pilot charge quantity as 10%, 20% and 30%. Subsequently, 10% EGR was employed for the test with 30% pilot injection quantity upon realising that the respective NOx emissions were the highest for the same. All the results were compared with the test results while utilising diesel at 600 bar injection pressure. For OPO20 the brake thermal efficiency at full load was observed to be 31.37% higher and the brake specific fuel consumption 5.53% lower than that for diesel. In-cylinder pressure values recorded were almost similar to diesel corresponding to brake power. Heat release rate was significantly higher in case of orange peel oil. Additionally, it was found that smoke, unburned hydrocarbons content and carbon monoxide emission decreased by 16.30%, 27.63% and 42.28% respectively in the engine exhaust. Oxides of nitrogen were recorded to be 15.46% higher than that of diesel. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - With impending economical concerns and fuel crisis, biodiesel produced from microalgae has been proposed as a potential substitute for petroleum fuel. But experimental characterisation of combustion, performance and emission behaviour of biofuel operating under different operating conditions would be resource consuming. Even numerical modelling using computational fluid mechanics methods would be computationally consuming when combinatorics of all operating conditions are considered. In this study, we append empirical modelling to numerical modelling to derive industry feasible solutions. An artificial neural network was trained with responses at limited operating conditions obtained from a software Diesel-RK. Various variables representing combustion, performance and emission behaviour of IC engine were predicted accurately with average r-value of 0.9801 ± 0.0146 for operating conditions defined by blending, loading and fuel injection pressure. Redundancy amongst the system variables was also observed thus indicating to possible reduced empirical models. © 2018

AB  - Microalgae, the world's largest group of photosynthetic organisms, convert atmospheric CO2 to polar and neutral lipids using sunlight, which after esterification can be utilized for biodiesel production. In the present study, a fully compartmentalized metabolic network was developed to describe the metabolism of Chlorella vulgaris based on known enzymatic reactions and typical metabolic pathways of green algae. Flux balance analysis was employed to optimize the speciﬁc growth rate and the lipid production rate using measured exchange ﬂuxes of the metabolites. The experimental data for batch and fed batch algal fermentation systems acquired from the literature were used to validate the accuracy of the pseudo- steady state model. The physiological pathways of the microalgae for lipid biosynthesis were identified. The simulation revealed that the microalgae would be able to produce higher levels of lipid content (43.6%) during N-starvation cultivation under 100 μmol m−2 s−1 light intensity, 0.25 vvm aeration with 2% (v/v) CO2, 2 mg L−1 PO4-P, and 5 mg L−1 NO3-N. Sensitivity analysis showed that CO2, light energy, O2, and nitrate were the most important factors affecting the lipid production at N-deficient conditions. The findings consequential for manipulation of the metabolism of the microalgae with optimal activity. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - It was demonstrated recently that quantitative temperature and CO measurements can be conducted by spontaneous Raman scattering (SRS) in non-sooting diesel-like biofuel jets in a vessel. In contrast, n-heptane is used as the fuel in the present study. This leads to slightly increased sooting tendency. One-dimensional temperature and CO measurements are generally performed successfully. Fuel-injection pressure is varied and the flame structure is characterized, including the jet core. Effects of pre-combustion mixture inhomogeneity are particularly observed at lower injection pressure (700 bar). Strong deviations from adiabatic-equilibrium conditions in terms of temperature and CO mole fraction are observed in particularly fuel-rich fluid parcels. CO formation is apparently affected by turbulent mixing there. Relatively low temperatures are measured around the flame lift-off region, in particular for the highest injection pressure (1500bar), indicating turbulence-chemistry interaction. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this work, the adsorption desulfurization performance and adsorption diffusion study of B2O3 modified Ag-CeOx/TiO2-SiO2 adsorbent were investigated. The adsorption desulfurization performance was studied by batch and fixed bed tests. The homogeneous surface diffusion model (HSDM) was employed to investigate the adsorption and diffusion behavior of 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (4,6-DMDBT) in diesel. It was found that the addition of B2O3 promotes the dispersion of CeOx species and then further facilitates the dispersion and oxidation of Ag species resulting in higher adsorption desulfurization activity. Ag species are in state of Ag, Ag2O and Ag2O2, among which, Ag2O and Ag2O2 are found to be the active centers. The kinetics of adsorption desulfurization of model diesel fuel was investigated to provide guiding significance for the prediction of breakthrough curves of fixed-bed adsorption columns. The batch kinetic experiment modeled by HSDM model indicates that surface diffusion controls the main rate. The surface diffusion coefficient Ds determined by batch adsorption experiments is independent of operation conditions, which can be used to directly predict the breakthrough behavior in fixed bed adsorption. The modified HSDM model is proposed to describe the breakthrough behavior. Results indicate that the breakthrough time is affected by bed height, flowrate and influent concentration. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biofuel has benefits of reduction in CO2 and engine exhaust emissions, so it has been attracting more attention in the past few decades. In this study, the partial oxidation reforming of biodiesel (fatty acid methyl esters, hereafter, FAME) and a new generation renewable hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) are evaluated using a thermodynamic analysis and an experimental investigation. The thermodynamic analysis is used to evaluate the effect of the O2/FAME and O2/HVO molar ratios on hydrogen-rich syngas production. The results show that under the best operating conditions at 800 °C and an O2/FAME molar ratio of 10, the concentration of the H2 is 21.96%, and the syngas yield is 45.50%; at an O2/HVO molar ratio of 10, the concentration of H2 is 23.01%, and the syngas yield is 45.14%. In the FAME experimental results, when the air to fuel ratio is 4.70, the H2 concentration is 18.80%, the CO concentration is 22.87%, and the reforming efficiency is 72.80%. Moreover, for HVO reforming under the air to fuel ratio of 6.30, the H2 concentration is 17.65%; the CO concentration is 17.67%, and the reforming efficiency is 62.87%. Because the composition of HVO is more complex than that of FAME, the reforming efficiency for HVO is lower than that for FAME. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present work long term storage chemical and biological stability of three different commercial Brazilian biodiesel fuels have been studied. Commercial biodiesel fuels from soybean, beef tallow, and blend soybean/beef tallow were initially kept for 60 days in their original containers at the laboratory. Subsequently, the biodiesels were transferred to 1 L carbon steel containers and stored at the laboratory for 90 days exposed to room temperature and humidity. Monthly analyzes of some biodiesel chemical characteristics were conducted. After 90 days, biodiesel samples were sent to be evaluated for their susceptibility to microbial contamination by biomass formation and fuel degradationby FTIR. Results show that after 30 days all biodiesel went out of specification to the water content parameter. Similar result was found for the oxidative stability parameter, except for pure beef tallow biodiesel, which went out of specification after 60 days to the acid value parameter. In terms of microbial contamination, at the end of 60 days, the highest biomass formation occurred in pure soybean biodiesel, followed by blend soybean/beef tallow, and neat beef tallow biodiesels. However, the higher ester carbonyl degradation was observed for 100% beef tallow biodiesel. Thus, in the experimental conditions of this study, the limited shelf life of all studied biodiesels was drastically reduced by the hygroscopicity of the fuel, which acts as a facilitator of other degradative processes, including microbial contamination. The commercial soybean biodiesel was considered more vulnerable to long term storage due to its reduced oxidative stability, as well as its higher susceptibility to microbial development. Special care should be addressed by the time that this sort of biodiesel is added to the diesel, unless more robust antioxidant and multipack additives are used, and special handling practices are adopted. © 2018

AB  - Catalytic hydrothermal conversion diesel (CHCD-76), synthesized isoparaffin (SIP-76), and hydroprocessed renewable diesel (HRD-76) have been produced in sufficient quantity and supplied to the U.S. Navy for blending with traditional marine diesel NATO F-76. The present work investigates the storage and oxidation stabilities of DSH-76, CHCD-76, and their blends with F-76. Chemical composition and physicochemical properties of these two biofuels, including viscosity, density, peroxide value, heat of combustion, acid number, and phase behavior, were determined using required ASTM methods. ASTM D4625 and D5304 methods were employed to investigate the long-term storage stability of these two biofuels and theirs blends with F-76. ASTM D5304 method was also modified to investigate the oxidation process of these fuel samples. In addition, ASTM D2274 tests were conducted to investigate oxidation stability of the neat and blended fuel samples. The influence of long-term storage and oxidation on fuel physicochemical properties was investigated based on ASTM methods. SIP-76 and CHCD-76 were found have superior storage and oxidation stability in comparison with petroleum F-76. This is also the first report on storage and oxidation stability of SIP-76 and CHCD-76. © 2018

AB  - Triacyl-, diacyl- and monoacylglycerols (TAGs, DAGs, MAGs) along with monocarboxylic acids (MCAs) are intermediate products in many triacylglycerol oil-to-biofuel conversion pathways. Accumulation of these compounds leads to poor biofuel characteristics and may result in fuel system damage. We developed a method for simultaneous identification and quantification of a wide range of MCAs (C 4 -C 18 ), MAGs, DAGs, and TAGs. The method is based on trimethylsilylation followed by high temperature GC with programmed temperature vaporizer (PTV) injection coupled to parallel FID and MS detectors (HTGC-FID/MS). To minimize the discrimination of both low and high molecular weight species typically occurring on the injector, we optimized injection conditions using a central composite design. The critical variables were the time at initial temperature (40 °C), splitless time, and the interaction between these two parameters. Among three tested electron ionization source/quadrupole analyzer temperatures, a 350/200 °C setting provided the highest response and signal-to-noise ratio for TAGs and did not have an effect on MAGs and DAGs. Similar results were obtained when quantifying target analytes in intermediate products of soybean oil cracking with FID and MS (using specific acylglycerol fragmentation ions). The instrumental FID limits of detection (LODs) were 0.07–0.27 ng for most of the target analytes. Selected ion monitoring (SIM) LODs were 0.01–0.05 ng for MCAs and 0.03–0.14 ng for acylglycerols. For the total ion current (TIC), LODs observed increased with acyl chain length and degree of unsaturation, resulting in an increase from 0.05 to 0.18 ng for MCAs (C 5 to C 18 ) and from 0.03 to 1.8 ng for acylglycerols (TAGs C 8 to C 22 ). Deviations in the repeatability of sample preparation, intra- and inter-day analyses, including sample stability over an eight-day time period, did not exceed 10% variance. These results demonstrate that the developed method is accurate and robust for the determination of acylglycerols and MCAs produced during the processing of TAGs into biofuels. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Low chemical stability and high oxygen content limit utilization of the bio-based platform chemical 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF) in biofuels development. In this work, Lewis-acid-catalyzed conversion of renewable 6-deoxy sugars leading to formation of more stable 5-methylfurfural (MF) is carried out with high selectivity. Besides its higher stability, MF is a deoxygenated analogue of HMF with increased C/O ratio. A highly selective synthesis of the innovative liquid biofuel 2,5-dimethylfuran starting from MF under mild conditions is described. The superior synthetic utility of MF against HMF in benzoin and aldol condensation reactions leading to long-chain alkane precursors is demonstrated. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

AB  - Homologation of bioethanol to butanol and higher alcohols by means of Guerbet reaction was performed with a novel ruthenium based bifunctional catalyst under homogeneous conditions in the presence of a basic cocatalyst. Reaction screening demonstrated that the new catalyst shows conversions and selectivity comparable with some of ruthenium based bifunctional catalysts recently reported in the literature. The reaction occurs in pure ethanol as well as in ethanol from wine waste furnished by CAVIRO distillery with up to 46% conversion of ethanol and an overall selectivity to higher alcohols of 91% and a minor carbon loss. Based on the laboratory results, an industrialization study was carried out in order to propose a viable technological solution. The experimental data consistency was verified, and the results were up-scaled to design a reactor working in a batch or, potentially, semibatch operation mode. Further analysis of the overall process, together with the introduction of dedicated figures of merit have allowed the estimation of the process performance both in mass and energetic terms, and the outcome was integrated into a life cycle analysis. Although preliminary, the multidisciplinary approach has converged toward complementary results; more specifically, the adoption of the base cocatalyst NaOEt has showed similar performance in terms of specific alcohols production and energy demand compared to the NaOH case. Moreover, this last case proves to be better from an environmental perspective (LCA). © Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A method to produce the biofuel 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) from cellulose-derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) by hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) using commercial gasoline as solvent to obtain mixtures of gasoline with DMF, appropriate for direct use in present internal combustion engines, is presented. Best results were obtained with gasoline:ethanol mixtures in the ratio 9:1 (E10), as ethanol acts as a solvent mediator for the dissolution of HMF. Selected potential biofuels are also found to give high DMF yields, for example, several alcohols (81-92%) and 2-butanone (94%), while γ-valerolacton and saturated hydrocarbons show limitations (75% and 37%, respectively). The reaction in gasoline is conducted sequentially up to three times with an initial loading of 10 wt % HMF per step, resulting in a concentration increase of up to 7 wt % DMF for each step, by which a concentration range between 7 and 20 wt % DMF in the final blend is covered. The obtained blends were evaluated by the determination of the derived cetane number (DCN) and a simulated distillation with comparison to premixed blends and proved to be comparable in a wide concentration range of DMF (5-15 wt %). Thus, a potentially directly usable fuel blend is produced in a direct conversion process without the need of costly separation. Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: Based on our previous studies of 17 Prunus sibirica germplasms, one plus tree with high quality and quantity of seed oils has emerged as novel potential source of biodiesel. To better develop P. sibirica seed oils as woody biodiesel, a concurrent exploration of oil content, FA composition, biodiesel yield and fuel properties as well as prediction model construction for fuel properties was conducted on developing seeds to determine the optimal seed harvest time for producing high-quality biodiesel. Oil synthesis required supply of carbon source, energy and FA, but their transport mechanisms still remains enigmatic. Our recent 454 sequencing of P. sibirica could provide long-read sequences to identify membrane transporters for a better understanding of regulatory mechanism for high oil production in developing seeds. Results: To better develop the seed oils of P. sibirica as woody biodiesel, we firstly focused on a temporal and comparative evaluation of growth tendency, oil content, FA composition, biodiesel yield and fuel properties as well as model construction for biodiesel property prediction in different developing seeds from P. sibirica plus tree (accession AS-80), revealing that the oils from developing seeds harvested after 60 days after flowering (DAF) could be as novel potential feedstock for producing biodiesel with ideal fuel property. To gain new insight into membrane transport mechanism for high oil yield in developing seeds of P. sibirica, we presented a global analysis of transporter based on our recent 454 sequencing data of P. sibirica. We annotated a total of 116 genes for membrane-localized transporters at different organelles (plastid, endoplasmatic reticulum, tonoplast, mitochondria and peroxisome), of which some specific transporters were identified to be involved in carbon allocation, metabolite transport and energy supply for oil synthesis by both RT-PCR and qRT-PCR. Importantly, the transporter-mediated model was well established for high oil synthesis in developing P. sibirica seeds. Our findings could help to reveal molecular mechanism of increased oil production and may also present strategies for engineering oil accumulation in oilseed plants. Conclusions: This study presents a temporal and comparative evaluation of developing P. sibirica seed oils as a potential feedstock for producing high-quality biodiesel and a global identification for membrane transporters was to gain better insights into regulatory mechanism of high oil production in developing seeds of P. sibirica. Our findings may present strategies for developing woody biodiesel resources and engineering oil accumulation. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - In this study, renewable biofuels (ethanol and n-butanol) were utilized to synthesize carbon nanotubes on substrate of inexpensive metal mesh (copper alloy and nickel) using inverse diffusion flame. The effects of metal mesh, synthesis time and flame temperature on growth of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were investigated in details. The morphology and structure of CNTs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) and Raman spectroscopy. The results showed that there were no CNTs formed on nickel mesh. When the substrate was copper alloy mesh, the yield of CNTs increased from 2 min and reached maximum at about 15 min as the synthesis time increased. Under the condition of 15 min, CNTs synthesized in ethanol flame of 1023 K and in n-butanol flame of 1273 K had higher degree of graphitic structure. In addition, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with straight tube wall were synthesized in ethanol flame of 1023 K and 1273 K when the synthesis time was 15 min. For these experiments, CNTs with excellent quality could be synthesized effectively in ethanol flame with temperatures of 1023 K and 1273 K when the synthesis time was 15 min and the substrate was copper alloy mesh. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Non-fossil fuels for the commercial and passenger vehicle sector are gaining more importance due to their positive effects on exhaust gas emissions. Ongoing research investigating a broad variety of biofuels, synthetic fuels and regenerative fuels shows that a reduction of CO 2 emissions can be possible without major modifications to the existing vehicle infrastructure. An internal combustion engine is a complex system of physical and chemical mechanisms, all of which contribute to the performance output, exhaust gas composition, durability and longevity of the engine. Modifying the fuel will not only result in differing chemical reactions and thermodynamic efficiency but will also affect friction and wear through the dilution and degradation of the lubricant. This study aims to investigate the variation of friction and wear in a model system due to the introduction of oxymethylene ether and regular diesel fuel to the lubricant. High-frequency reciprocating rig experiments will be carried out on 100Cr6 steel specimen with laboratory aged fully formulated commercially available SAE 0W-20 grade engine oil containing defined amounts of OME 3−5 and regular diesel fuel. The surface of the steel specimen will be analysed using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. © 2018, © 2018 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining and Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Coal combustion is one of the most significant anthropogenic CO2 and air pollution sources globally. This paper studies the atmospheric emissions of a power plant fuelled with a mixture of industrial pellets (10.5%) and coal (89.5%). Based on the stack measurements, the solid particle number emission, which was dominated by sub-200 nm particles, was 3.4×1011 MJ-1 for the fuel mixture when electrostatic precipitator (ESP) was cleaning the flue gas. The emission factor was 50 mg MJ-1 for particulate mass and 11 740 ng MJ-1 for the black carbon with the ESP. In the normal operation situation of the power plant, i.e., including the flue-gas desulphurisation and fabric filters (FGD and FF), the particle number emission factor was 1.7×108 MJ-1, particulate mass emission factor 2 mg MJ-1 and black carbon emission factor 14 ng MJ-1. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis supported the particle number size distribution measurement in terms of particle size and the black carbon concentration. The TEM images of the particles showed variability of the particle sizes, morphologies and chemical compositions. The atmospheric measurements, conducted in the flue-gas plume, showed that the flue-gas dilutes closed to background concentrations in 200 sec. However, an increase in particle number concentration was observed when the flue gas aged. This increase in particle number concentration was interpret as formation of new particles in the atmosphere. In general, the study highlights the importance of detailed particle measurements when utilizing new fuels in existing power plants. Implications: CO2 emissions of energy production decrease when substituting coal with biofuels. The effects of fuels changes on particle emission characteristics have not been studied comprehensively. In this study conducted for a real-scale power plant, co-combustion of wood pellets and coal caused elevated black carbon emissions. However, it was beneficial from the total particle number and particulate mass emission point of view. Flue-gas cleaning can significantly decrease the pollutant concentrations but also changes the characteristics of emitted particles. Atmospheric measurements implicated that the new particle formation in the atmospheric flue-gas plume should be taken into account when evaluating all effects of fuel changes.” Are implication statements part of the manuscript?. © 2019, © 2019 A&WMA.

AB  - In the present study, response surface methodology (RSM) involving central composite design (CCD) was applied to optimize the reaction parameters of biodiesel production from yellow mustard (Sinapis alba L.) seed oil during the single-step transesterification process. A total of 30 experiments were designed and performed to determine under the effects of variables on the biodiesel yield such as methanol to oil molar ratio (2:1–10:1), catalyst concentration (0.2–1.0 wt.% NaOH), reaction temperature (50–70°C), and reaction time (30–90 min). The second order polynomial model was used to predict the biodiesel yield and coefficient of determination (R2) was found to be at 0.9818. The optimum biodiesel yield was calculated as 96.695% from the model with the following reaction conditions: 7.41:1 of methanol to oil molar ratio, 0.63 wt. % NaOH of catalyst concentration, 61.84°C of reaction temperature, and 62.12 min of reaction time. It is seen that the regression model results were in agreement with the experimental data. The results showed that RSM is a suitable statistical technique for optimizing the reaction parameters in the transesterification process in order to maximize the biodiesel yield. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The demand for bioenergy (biofuels, heat and electricity) is increasing steadily around the globe. Major policy-related interventions for adoption and promotion of bioenergy have also been realized by several countries over the past few decades. The biomass supply chain incorporates several components of bioenergy production, which in turn consist of several activities for which different alternative methods are available. Different components of the biomass supply chain include production of bioenergy feedstock (biomass), logistics of biomass, conversion of biomass to bioenergy, and distribution of bioenergy or bioenergy carriers for end use. The single largest limiting factor for the production of bioenergy is the unavailability of biomass. Dedicated, fast-growing and high-biomass-producing plantations on non-arable land and utilization of agro-industrial waste materials can overcome this problem. Holistic integration of different components of the biomass supply chain and activities involved therein along with judicious design are likely to enhance the quantum of energy return, improve the greenhouse gas balance and reduce the water footprint of the bioenergy production facility. Additionally, the emerging yet promising concept of lignocellulosic and algal biorefinery would require a careful and prudent design of the biomass supply chain to achieve one of the most attractive characteristic of bioenergy: environmental sustainability. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In this present work, the impact of blending n-Pentanol, a next-generation bio fuel with cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL) biodiesel, on the performance of a diesel engine is examined. Tests were performed on a constant-speed compression-ignition engine using n-Pentanol/CNSL biodiesel blends. n-Pentanol was added to CNSL biodiesel by 5% and 10% by volume. Performance parameters such as break thermal efficiency (BTE), Brake-specific fuel consumption and Exhaust gas temperature (EGT) were analysed in this work. It was experimentally found that by adding n-Pentanol to neat CNSL biodiesel, significant reduction in viscosity was observed. In addition, BTE was increased by 0.8% due to improved atomisation of the blends. Further, brake-specific fuel and EGT were further reduced due to lower viscosity and improved combustion rate with addition of n-Pentanol to CNSL biodiesel. Emission parameters such as Hydro carbon (HC), Carbon monoxide, Nitrogen oxides (NOx) and Smoke emissions were examined at different load conditions. Addition of n-Pentanol as additive improves the rate of combustion, mixing and vaporisation of the blends with air and reduces the emissions associated with it. Components were observed during the trail. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - With the global economy experiencing rapid growth, energy demands are rising at a very high rate, thus resulting in excessive utilisation of fossil fuel resources. To cope with the energy demand, extensive research is carried out in the field of alternative fuels. Biodiesel fuel has better fuel properties compared to petroleum diesel – it is renewable, non-toxic in nature and essen-tially free of sulphur and aromatics and can be used in any diesel engine without modification. One drawback of biodiesel is that it is susceptible to oxidation that can induce polymerization of the ester and can form insoluble gums and sediments that are known to cause fuel filter plugging. The present paper deals with the evaluation of the oxidation stability of biodiesel in dynamic contact with metals. The paper also investigates the impact of non-ferrous metals on the oxidation stability of various biofuel sources. The European diesel standard PN-EN 590 calls for determining oxidation stability at 110°C with a minimum induction time of 20 h with the use of the Rancimat method (PN-EN 15751). A negative effect of metals on oxidation stability was found. Metals have a catalytic effect on biodiesel stability. Even small concentrations of metal contaminants showed nearly the same impact on oxidation stability as large amounts. The strongest negative effect on oxidation stability was demonstrated by copper and lead. The dependence of oxidation stability on the type of metal and time of dynamic contact was shown. © 2019, Oil and Gas Institute – National Research Institute. All rights reserved.

AB  - Core Ideas: Varietal differences in salt tolerance were observed. There were differences in salt tolerance between the seedling emergence and seedling growth stages. Growth and photosynthesis decreased at high salinity, indicating osmotic stress. Chlorophyll fluorescence did not decrease at high salinity, indicating no stress on photosystem II. Leaf chloride concentrations varied among genotypes, suggesting different salt tolerance mechanisms. Salt-tolerant energy crops can be grown on marginal lands for sustainable biofuel production without competing with food crops for arable land. However, salt tolerance is a variable trait among plant species, varieties, and growth stages. In this study, the relative salt tolerance of seven mustard (Brassica juncea) genotypes and four rapeseed (Brassica napus) genotypes was evaluated at the seedling emergence and seedling growth stages. In the first experiment, seeds were sown in a growth chamber with reverse osmosis water or saline solution at an electrical conductivity (EC) of 10 mS cm−1 for 10 d, and emergence was determined daily. In the second experiment, seedlings were grown in a greenhouse and irrigated with nutrient solution (control) with an EC of 1.5 mS cm−1 or saline solutions (EC 5 and 10 mS cm−1, respectively) for 4 wk. For the seedling emergence stage, the relative emergence percent, and emergence index showed great variation among genotypes (range, 11–112% and 7–110%, respectively). For the seedling growth stage, the saline treatments caused reductions in leaf area and fresh and dry biomass that averaged 63, 65, and 65% relative to the control, respectively. Overall, hierarchal cluster analyses showed differences in salt tolerance between the seedling emergence and seedling growth stages. Net photosynthetic rate decreased with salinity, but soil-plant analysis development readings increased by an average of 18% in the EC10 treatment. Chlorophyll fluorescence did not change, but performance index tended to increase in response to salinity. Chloride concentrations in the leaf tissue increased with salinity and ranged from 32 to 111 mg g−1, with significant varietal differences. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - The biomass, which converted into alternative fuel, has become an attractive source of renewable energy because of the shortage and high prices of fossil fuels. The bio -energy is now accepted as having the potential to provide the major part of the projected renewable energy in the future. Pyrolysis is one of the three main thermal paths, along with gasification and combustion, for providing useful and valuable bio-fuel. The present work will consider Jatropha curcas seeds as the biomass source because Jatropha seeds have high energy bearing seeds available in nature. The fast pyrolysis of Jatropha was carried out in a fixed bed batch reactor made up of stainless steel at a temperature ranging from 400ᵒC to 550ᵒC to produce liquid biofuel at an interval of 50ᵒC. The effect of temperature on the fast pyrolysis of the material is studied to know the optimum temperature for maximum liquid yield. The thermal degradation of the Jatropha seed was studied using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) at a heating rate of 20ᵒC which indicated the range of temperature in which the rate of decomposition is maximum. Calcium oxide nano catalyst derived from waste eggshells was used to study the effect of using a catalyst in the fast pyrolysis of Jatropha seeds. The oil and catalytic oil were obtained at optimum temperatures analyzed according to their elemental analysis, fuel properties, functional groups present, and com-pounds’ presence. The result so obtained is compared with the commercial fuel. The chemical compositions of the bio -oils were investigated using FTIR and GC-MS. Properties of CaO catalyst were studied using EDX, SEM and XRD analyses. © 2019

AB  - This work aims at demonstrating the possibility of producing 2-butanol from lignocellulosic biomass through a new thermochemical approach. The production of biobutanol was carried out using different lignocellulosic feedstock through a 3-step process: first the whole lignocellulosic biomass is hydrolyzed under acid catalyst to produce levulinates, then the levulinates go through decarboxylation to produce 2-butanone which is, in a final step, reduced to produce of 2-butanol. The experimental conditions for the first two steps of the process were optimized using the response surface methodology (RSM). The latter could represent an opportunity for the production of economical second-generation butanol without having to go through the classical pathway requiring the production of sugar prior to microbial conversion. © 2019 WIT Press, www.witpress.com

AB  - Considering the fulfilment of future energy requirement in the world with green energy, it is necessary to consider the environmental pollution due to the use of conventional fossil fuel sources. Present environmental pollution caused by different fossil energy sources are discussed in detail. Advancement of biofuels as a green energy source and the environmental pollution savings due to the use of biofuel life cycle greenhouse gas emissions in comparison to the fossil fuels are discussed in detail. Finally, emission due to transportation with biofuels is compared with relevant fossil fuels. It is evident that the atmospheric CO2 and CH4, emitted as a product of combustion of fossil fuel are the main sources for global warming. It is well understood that the usage of bioethanol as a substitute for gasoline is a green effect saving. Further, bioethanol produced using sugar cane, corn and sugar beet reduces greenhouse effect about one third, relative to gasoline. But, vice versa for biodiesel. Considering emission due to transportation with biofuels, compared with relevant fossil fuels, few positive and negative merits could be observed. It can be concluded that usage of bio ethanol as a substitute for gasoline should be promoted considering energy saving and greenhouse effect saving. © 2019 International Journal of Renewable Energy Research.

AB  - Physicochemical properties of three biofuels suitable for combustion in automotive diesel engines were compared. Two samples represented commercial hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) with different low temperature properties, one sample represented traditional biodiesel, fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). One HVO sample and FAME were blended into mineral diesel fuel to form two series of mixed fuels. One series represented mixed fuels containing 7, 20, 30, and 50 vol. % of HVO, the other series represented mixed fuels containing the same amount of FAME. All pure fuels as well as all prepared blends were then analyzed and evaluated. The composition and properties of HVO samples are discussed in detail as well as the influence of biocomponents on properties of mixed fuels. © 2019 Society of Thermal Engineers of Serbia.

AB  - This study evaluates the welfare impacts of jatropha (Jatropha curcas) cultivation measured as consumption expend-iture per adult-equivalent for smallholders in southern Malawi. Household survey data from the southern region of Malawi collected in 2014 from 303 smallholders using purposive and random selection strategies were used. Propensity score matching and endogenous switching regression methods were employed to address the selection bias problem and to control for observed and unobserved covariate effects. The analysis suggests that when selection bias and endogeneity were accounted for, jatropha cultivating farmers’ welfare was lower as compared to their counterparts. In the absence of tangible empirical evidence on welfare benefits to smallholder jatropha feedstock pro-ducers, this study concludes that jatropha is unlikely to bring meaningful welfare benefits to smallholders. As such, further research should consider pursuing other potential biofuel options like ‘moringa’ for biodiesel in the future Malawi biofuels policy. These findings also show that biofuels are not a panacea to the rural development and welfare of smallholders. Rather, the results suggest that programme initiatives which build household assets need to be encouraged to improve the plight of rural households largely dependent on agriculture. © Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Recent environmental and economic concerns have prompted resurgence in the use of biofuels throughout the world; there is increase in CO2 emissions as well as several other air pollutants. Edible and non-edible seed oil crops have proven to be recognised sources of vegetable oils for biodiesel production, although the production process has been developed for edible seed oil. Hence this paper highlights the production of biodiesel from plant seed oil, some of the factors that influence its production, the criteria the pure biodiesel must meet, the conversion techniques and the various methods of production acknowledging transesterification as the preferred choice. The aim of this study is the production of biodiesel by choosing the method and raw material with high efficiency. © 2019, Scibulcom Ltd.. All rights reserved.

AB  - Jatropha is an oilseed with high potential for biodiesel and biofuel production. However, studies are scarce about the effect of water and nutritional requirement in the oil quality and composition. Therefore, the objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of potassium fertilization and irrigation on the composition of jatropha oil. The treatments consisted of four potassium fertilization levels: 40, 80, 120, and 160 kg ha-1, and four irrigation levels: 0% (without irrigation), 40%, 80% and 120% of Class A pan evaporation (ECA). The experimental was design in randomized blocks with subdivided plots and four replicates. The mechanical method by pressing was used to extract oil from the seeds, using gas chromatography to obtain the oil composition. Fertilization and irrigation treatments promoted changes in the quality of jatropha seeds oil. Plants fertilized with 120 kg ha-1 of K2O and with irrigation level of 80% of ECA show the best results. © 2019, Universidade Estadual Paulista - UNESP. All rights reserved.

AB  - The development of new technologies which increase the production of biofuel without directly compete with food production is required. Microalgal biomass has recently been in the highlight. The role of this biomass is here discussed within the concept of biorefinery and industrial sustainability of bioethanol production. The process of cultivation in order to accumulate around 50% of carbohydrates in the biomass (dry weight) and the importance of water and nutrient recycling are reviewed. Saccharification of biomass using enzymes or acids and alternative processes such as hydrothermal liquefaction and flash hydrolysis are addressed. Since the main monosaccharide in microalgal biomass is glucose, high rates of hydrolysis and fermentation were, generally, achieved (more than 80% of the efficiency as a sum of these two processes). Anaerobic digestion to treat vinasse and the recycling of CO2 from the ethanolic fermentation and biogas could increase the process sustainability. Alternative techniques for the concentration of bioethanol from fermentation broth and for the optimization of fuel transportation are mentioned. Finally, the advantage of using microalgae rather than other sources is estimated with reference to the production rate, even though the cultivation costs are still high. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - This study aims to explore the solvent extraction of jojoba oil from the ground seeds of jojoba shrub (Simmondsia chinensis) cultivated in Taif region-Saudi Arabia and production of biodiesel from it as an alternative renewable energy source. The transesterification reaction of the extracted jojoba oil was carried out in a microwave reactor at 60°C using methanol: oil in a molar ratio of 7.5:1 with vigorous stirring (800 rpm). This microwave assisted process achieved quantifiable conversion of the jojoba oil to biofuel after 1 h compared to 4 h under conventional methods. The chemical compositions of the crude prodcut were determined using Gas chromatography-Mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In addition, the physicochemical properties to of the separated biodiesel were determined according Saudi Standard, Metrology and Quality Org (SASO) FDS 30183; 2018. The results of the performance tests applied to the obtained biodiesel showed an appropriate density and high calorific value of 0.8766 g.cm-3 and 41.226 j.g-1 respectively. The fluidity of the extracted biofuel assessed through kinematic viscosity was found to be 5.73 mm2s-1 which was superior to that obtained by conventional heating transesterification (5.73 mm2s-1 vs. 9.04 mm2s-1). This viscosity value is close to the European standard for biodiesel (3.5-5.0 mm2s-1). The physicochemical and combustion characteristics were found to be in conformity with the Saudi Arabian clean diesel fuel (low Sulphur) specifications. © 2019 World Research Association.

AB  - Defence sector desires to attain energy self-sufficiency and security. In recent years, emergence of biofuel as an alternative source has raised the hopes of Defence. Ethanol and bio-diesel are currently being used as blends in different parts of the world. While, bio-diesel is mostly being blended in 2-20 per cent in different parts of the world, ethanol blending has reached upto 85 per cent. Owing to the sustainability reasons, the choice of feedstock for ethanol production is gradually changing from corn to lignocelluloses biomass. Jatropha curcas, is still the choice feedstock for bio-diesel in most third world countries. This institute has put in rigrous efforts to identify high yielding varieties of Jatropha, improving its yield, standardising trans-esterification to obtain high quality bio-diesel and its trials and testing in various vehicles and equipment. Second generation biofuels using biomass such as farm and forest wastes as feedstocks are promising in terms of their overall sustainability and volume produced. They can be used as drop in fuels. However, time is required to utilise their potential fully. Algae, the third generation biofuel feedstock still needs extensive R&D to make it economically sustainable. Whatever, the technology used, defence forces will accept any biofuel, which should be available constantly and priced below the existing petroleum fuels. The scope of producing by-products and finding a lucarative market for these products can ensure that prices of biofuels remain lower than the petroleum fuels. © 2019, DESIDOC.

AB  - A study was carried out on CO2 reforming catalysts using ethanol based on biofuels for the production of syngas(CO, H2), a reducing agent for NOx reduction. Ni catalyst in various supports, such as γ-AI2O3, MgO-Al2O3, SiO2, CeO2, ZrO2, showed great synthetic gas production capability, and through evaluation, resistance to performance and carbon impaction was compared. The performance assessments of the catalyst were carried out by lowering the temperature to a 50 °C range from 850 °C to 700 °C. The reaction products were analyzed via IR. The characterization of the catalysts were performed through BET, XRD, and TPR, and TG analysis was performed to check the amount of deposited coke in catalysts after the reaction. In this study, Ni/MgO-Al2O3 showed an enhanced performance on carbon deposition. Copyright © 2019 KSAE.

AB  - At the present stage of development of engine manufacturing technology, the main normalized indicators of transport diesel engines are the exhaust gas toxicity indicators. An effective way of improving these indicators is the use of alternative fuels. Promising alternative fuels are considered to be biofuels derived from renewable vegetable raw materials. The paper considered the opportunity of using linseed, mustard, and camelina oils as ecological additives to petroleum diesel fuel. Experimental studies of an automobile diesel engine of type 4H 11/12.5 fueled with mixtures of petroleum diesel fuel blended with these vegetable oils were carried out. The volume fraction of vegetable oil in the blended fuels was up to 10%. A multicriteria method for optimization of the composition of vegetable oil-blended biofuels was proposed. Emissions of nitrogen oxides and soot from exhaust gases were considered as the main evaluation criteria of engine emission characteristics. The addition of 10% vegetable oil to petroleum diesel fuel allowed reducing nitrogen oxide emissions by 4–10% and smoke opacity by 11–16%. A decrease in the content of carbon monoxide in the exhaust gas by 5–15% and light unburned hydrocarbons by 11–17% was noted. When the diesel engine was fueled by the studied blends, the engine efficiency change did not exceed 3%. © 2019 by Begell House, Inc.

AB  - The utilization of artificial neural networks (ANN) for the prediction of biofuel properties, engine performance parameters, and emission of gases within statutory regulations in engine research has been topical in recent times and is predicted to replace the cumbersome and highly technical requirements of real-time engine testing. This study developed an ANN model to predict the engine performance and emission parameters of an unmodified compression ignition (CI) engine fueled with biodiesel using two fatty acid compositions as inputs. The ANN model adopted the backpropagation with Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, tangent-sigmoid transfer function comprising two, eight, and eight nodes as input, hidden, and output layers respectively. The overall regression coefficient (R) was found to be 0.9998 while the R-value for predicted outputs ranged between 0.9966 and 0.9997, the root mean square error varied between 0.01834 and 0.1725, and the mean absolute percentage error was reported to be between 1.6243 % and 4.546 % showing an acceptable prediction accuracy. It was found that the MATLAB NNTool is a reliable and effective tool for the prediction of engine performance parameters and emission of CI engines using two fatty acid compositions as inputs thereby minimize the time, cost, and infrastructural requirements of real-time engine test. © International Research Publication House.

AB  - The recovery of ethanol and butanol in aqueous solutions using adsorption on bone char was analyzed. Adsorption kinetics and isotherms were quantified where the effect of initial concentration, pH and temperature on alcohol adsorption was evaluated. Results showed that butanol was preferably adsorbed than ethanol due to its higher hydrophobicity. In particular, the maximum adsorption capacities of bone char to ethanol and butanol adsorption were 7.58 and 8.78 mmol/g, respectively, at pH 6 and 30 °C. It was also observed that pH and temperature significantly affected the recovery of these potential biofuels. © 2019 Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Union of Chemists in Bulgaria

AB  - The authors of the article explain the necessity of using eco-friendly biofuel for motor vehicles. The possibilities and ways of using biofuel in motor vehicles on the basis of alcohols (methanol, ethanol) and methyl ester of rapeseed oil are analyzed. The physical and chemical properties of these biofuel types are presented. In order to develop, determine and optimize the composition of eco-friendly biofuel for motor diesel engines, the authors have tested them during their work in methanol, ethanol-fuel emulsions and methyl ester of rapeseed oil. It has been experimentally established that the use of eco-friendly fuel in transport diesel engines is possible in the form of alcohol-fuel emulsions (alcohol (methanol or ethanol) is 25.0%, detergent-dispersant additive succinimide C-5A is 0.5%, water is 7.0%, diesel fuel is 67.5%) and in the form of separate supply of methanol (88.0%) and methyl ester of rapeseed oil (12.0%). The experimental research of motor diesel engines working on eco-friendly biofuel types of the above mentioned compositions has been carried out and the perspective decision of improving their environmental performance has been explained. When the diesel engine is operating on a methanol-fuel emulsion, the reduction in the pollutant content in the exhaust gases takes place: nitrogen oxides reduces by 41.3%, carbon soot reduces by 85.5%, carbon dioxide reduces by 6.7%, carbon monoxide reduces by 45.0%. When working on ethanol-fuel emulsion there is a decrease in nitrogen oxides by 50.2%, in carbon soot by 80.7%, in carbon dioxide by 23.8%, in carbon monoxide by 25.0%. And when working on methanol and rapeseed oil methyl ester there is a decrease in nitrogen oxides by 47.4%, in carbon soot by 90.4%, in carbon monoxide by 44.8%. © 2019.

AB  - Due to the high demand for liquid fuel in industrial and transportation sectors, there is a rapid hike in prices. In recent years, biofuels are gaining importance to meet the future demand for sustainable energy, reduction in dependency on fossil fuels and global environmental pollution. In this research work, different blends of Karanja oil biodiesel and Eucalyptus oil have been used as an alternative of diesel. The Karanja oil is converted into biodiesel by using esterification and transesterification reactions for enhancing its various properties. The performance and emission parameters such as brake specific fuel consumption, brake thermal efficiency, smoke density and exhaust gas temperature of 4.4 kW single-cylinder 4-stroke diesel engine have been measured and the optimum blends which provide the best output of these parameters are identified. 30% and 40% Karanja oil methyl ester with 70% and 60% of eucalyptus oil fuel blends respectively were marked as the best fuel blends for diesel engine with full replacement of diesel. The results of this experiment have been analyzed and compared with standard diesel also. © 2019 National Society of Environmental Science and Engineering (SNSIM).

AB  - Algae-based biofuels are the most capable solutions to energy catastrophe and global warming for years to come due to its potentially high yield, higher growth rate, biodegradable, nontoxic, carbon neutral, low emission profile, use of non-arable land and non-potable water with less attention and resource consumption. A biofuel produced from chlorella algae oil througha transesterification process was used in this study. Experimental tests were performed on a single cylinder, four stroke, direct injection, naturally aspirated diesel engine at constant engine speed of 1500 rpm and compression ratio of 18 at various loading conditions to evaluate the performance, emission, and combustion characteristics using algae biofuel blends of 5%, 10%, 20%, and 30%, moreover the results are compared with those of standard diesel. The brake thermal efficiency showed decreasing trend (upto 5%) whereas specific fuel consumption (upto 7%)and exhaust gas temperature (upto 3%) showed increasing trend for algae biofuel blends compared to diesel. Reduction in hydrocarbon (upto 28%) and carbon monoxide (upto 22%) emission was noted for algae biofuel blends along with a marginal increase in NOx (upto 13%) emissions. Also, algae biofuel blends showed almost comparable combustion results compared to conventional diesel, however, the blends confirm shortened ignition delay due to their earlier start of combustion. From this study, we can conclude that small fraction by volume (20%) of algae biofuel addition with diesel has exhibited satisfactory results and could be used as a good substitute for petrodiesel fuel. © Yildiz Technical University.

AB  - This Concawe report is the second in a series of publications that explore opportunities and challenges for EU refineries to integrate technologies and feedstocks that would reduce the fossil carbon intensity of petroleum products. It defines two potential 2050 demand scenarios followed by the description of the conversion pathways required for the integration of the selected low-carbon feedstocks within a notional mid-range European refinery. The results of the modeling exercise are presented, moving from mostly oil based cases, where the EU refineries meet the 2050 demand in the most plausible CO2 efficient manner consistent with the first report, to the progressive integration of low-carbon feedstocks illustrated by two series of cases, namely Limited penetration cases (individual pathways) and maximum low carbon feestock cases (combined pathways). In all the cases modeled, the implications in terms of feedstock supply, key processing requirements, e.g., hydrogen and electricity and the impact such changes have on the CO2 emissions intensity both at refinery level and for the end products in Europe are initially assessed and quantified. Potential impacts and synergies with the existing assets, as crude oil is progressively replaced, were also investigated.

AB  - Using niobium compounds as heterogeneous catalysts in biodiesel production is a promising methodology from economic and environmental viewpoints. However, the application of niobium catalysts still is a challenge due to the high temperatures and pressures for moderate biofuel yields. Therefore, easily handled and applied materials have been developed to optimize biofuel production, which is the goal of this study. Nb2O5 and ammonium niobium oxalate (AmNO) were activated in reflux and ultrasound-assisted system. Nb2O5 showed better activity under reflux, using methanol. The characterizations conclude that the Lewis-acid sites are determinant for higher conversion rather than surface area. AmNO has better activity also in the reflux system at 70 °C, against 170 °C for Nb2O5, reaching above 70% conversion. In addition, reactions in ultrasound-assisted systems are also appealing due to the lower time and temperature, with conversion rates above 40%. Both catalysts showed interesting results under milder conditions than those in the literature. © 2019 Sociedade Brasileira de Química.

AB  - In response to the escalating energy crisis and related pollution problems, there is an urgent need to adopt new energy supply technologies that utilize renewable energy sources in an efficient and environmentally friendly manner. Today, approximately 65 million tons of hydrogen are produced annually worldwide. Steam reforming of natural gas is the prevalent hydrogen production technology. Hydrogen is increasingly considered as a fuel for transport applications. Production from logistic fuels is considered a viable option to accelerate market introduction of hydrogen as an alternative energy carrier. Today, hydrogen is predominantly produced by steam reforming of natural gas in large-scale, central production plants. However, with an increasing share of fuel cell vehicles in the market, central hydrogen production will suffer from additional costs associated with the distribution of gaseous-phase hydrogen by trailer over long distances. In contrast, distributed hydrogen generation (DHG) at fueling stations offers the advantage of using readily available liquid fuels, e.g., diesel and biodiesel with high energy densities and existing infrastructure. DHG is widely seen as a promising alternative in the transition phase toward a fully renewable hydrogen production economy.

AB  - One of the most important problems in the worldwide community is the replacement of fossil fuels with renewable sources. One of the most promising renewable sources is considered lignocellulosic biomass for it has high productivity, requires low agricultural inputs, has positive environmental impacts, is easy to process, and does not compete with food crops. In particular, from this raw material is possible to obtain different types of biofuels, e.g., syngas, bio-oil, and bioethanol. This chapter is focused on the production of bioethanol from renewable sources and the various steps of the production processes and the implementation of the technology by membrane reactors.

AB  - European legislation since the 2000 has progressively imposed the use of renewable energy in various sectors, including transport, to limit the emissions of greenhouse gases responsible for climate change. Biofuels are already an important contributor to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in transport and they will be even more so in the future. Biofuels together with other products and emerging technologies, e.g., the use of natural gas (compressed and liquefied) and electric vehicles, represent one of the pillars of the decarbonization of the transport sector. The technologies for the production of high-quality biodiesel have been developed. Hydrogenated vegetable oil compared with normal biodiesel has excellent characteristics, and when mixed with mineral diesel, it is possible to formulate premium products with better combustion and lower polluting emissions.

AB  - Since the long history of Indonesia, the majority of Indonesian residence are working as farmers as the primary job. Plantation in Indonesia supplies the world market in remarkable amount. There are several main commodity holding important role in Indonesian agriculture: rice, sugarcane, coffee, cocoa, cassava, and tobacco. Those products are cultivated in a large amount almost in each district and consequently generating a large amount of agricultural waste from the postharvesting process. The residue of those commodity were studied in this paper, including rice husks, sugarcane bagasse, spent coffee ground, cocoa pod husks, cassava peels, and tobacco stalks. They contain mostly cellulose of 29.1-57.4 % and hemicellulose of 7.49-35.5 % which are convertible to fermentable sugar. The lignin content in the range of 10.9-27.3 % which produces inhibitors in sugar and alcohol production. The utilization of this feedstock to produce biobutanol and bioethanol requires delignification process to prevent the inhibitor formation. Sequentially, hydrolysis is necessary to convert the cellulose and hemicellulose to fermentable sugars completely by using enzymatic or chemical process. Finally fermentation can be performed to produce bioethanol by yeast or biobutanol by Clostridium sp. The uniformity of the main constituent and the physical characteristic have made them potential to be efficiently utilized in heterogeneous mixture to produce large capacity of biobutanol and bioethanol. © 2019, Asian Research Publishing Network.

AB  - - Biodiesel production using acid oils is an important alternative for biofuel cost reduction. However, it is a huge challenge for homogeneous transesterification, the main industrial route commonly used. This paper presents macauba oil with high acidity, 43.90 w/w%, as a potential raw material for biodiesel production. The acidity was reduced to 0.8 w/w% after re-esterification (80 min) with glycerol at high temperature (235 °C), without catalysts. Zinc (powder and coating) and NbOPO4 were also tested as catalysts in comparison with the reaction without a catalyst. Reactions catalyzed by metallic Zn produced a large amount of Zn carboxylate, an undesirable soap, due to the high Zn leaching. In contrast with the literature, Zinc did not show good catalytic activity, as confirmed by the kinetic parameters. NbOPO4 was not a good catalyst, too. Reaction without catalysts was performed using nitrogen as a carrier gas and it was compared with reaction under vacuum to remove co-produced water. Nitrogen showed the best result for re-esterification, avoiding degradation reactions. Triglycerides (TG) were the prevalent products in reactions using nitrogen. After re-esterification, the oil was easily converted into biodiesel with high ester content (98.4%) of methyl ester by alkaline transesterification. © 2019 Assoc. Brasiliera de Eng. Quimica / Braz.

AB  - In line with the growing environmental awareness developed along the last decades, modern societies are urged to evolve into sustainable economics where the reuse of organic wastes represents the key feedstock for a green transaction. The oil phase obtained from different biomasses has the potential to be a source of food supplements, medicines, cosmetics, or feedstock for biofuel production. In the present work, the composition of 104 different biomasses including seeds, peels, flowers, plants, and leaves has been reviewed for the lipid content. Based on the most frequent fatty acids screened, experimental data for normal boiling point temperature, normal melting point, critical properties, and acentric factor were collected and compared with the most common estimation methods, which are functions of the molecular structure and interaction between different functional groups. New predictive equations have been proposed to reduce the estimation deviation and to provide simple correlations to be used in simulation software when dealing with biomass processes. For all the properties, the estimations proposed have an absolute average deviation equal to or lower than 4.6%. © 2019 Ana M. Sousa et al.

AB  - Renewable fuels are desirable as alternate fuels with ignition quality equivalent to diesel and its combustion parameters, but unsuitable for direct operation in diesel engines as fuel because of their higher viscosity. Hence, fuel and engine-based modifications are being developed to improve the performance, emission and combustion behaviour of the compression ignition engines. The higher viscosity of fuel oil does not let it vaporize even after it is being injected into the combustion chamber. Therefore, converting the higher viscosity of vegetable oil into biodiesel improves the atomization resulting in better combustion. Issues related to the use of biodiesel as working fuel are its oxidation stability and performance. In this study, safflower oil, neem oil and corn oil are used as fuel oils. The experimental results displayed a significant increase in the brake thermal efficiency of 28.25% for corn oil methyl ester (COME). HC and CO emissions are lower with corn oil methyl ester. At full load, the smoke emission reduces slightly with corn oil methyl ester about 58% opacity respectively, but it is still lower than diesel having 66.2% opacity. © 2019 Technoscience Publications.

AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative and renewable biofuel for blending with fossil-based diesel. One of the challenges is to design the supply-chain network for biohydrodeoxygenated diesel (BHD) under uncertainty from both raw materials availability and the demand. The supply chain with four echelons; suppliers, factories, inventories and customers has been studied. The biodiesel factory has been simulated by commercial simulation program Pro/II to find the utility cost and biodiesel production capacity. In this study, the stochastic optimization is used to solve mathematical model of the BHD supply chain network. The proposed model is based on stochastic mixed-integer programming with chance constraints. The chance constrained optimization has been applied to design supply chain network under the uncertainty at different levels of confidence. Then optimized supply chain network has been investigated on stability of the supply chain network under the uncertainties, accuracy of the profit and the effect of penalty. This study shows profit and trade-off between profit and penalty cost with different levels of confidence of BHD supply chain under uncertainties in raw-material supply and biodiesel demand. The results show that the chance constrained optimization can be used to design optimum supply chain network under uncertainties within levels of confidence. Copyright © 2019, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a herbaceous perennial grass that can be used as bedding for livestock, planted in buffer strips, and used as biofuel, but it is still not widely grown in eastern Canada. The objectives of this study were to verify the performance of the Integrated Farm System Model (IFSM) in simulating switchgrass growth and to estimate its yield potential and production costs in eastern Canada. The performance of IFSM was assessed with dry matter (DM) yield of switchgrass (‘Cave-in-Rock’) measured over three growing seasons (2015–2017) in southern Quebec, Canada. The model performed reasonably well, with normalized root mean square errors of 19.5% for calibration and 27.9% for validation. Simulation results of potential yield and economic management over the long term (1986–2015) for five switchgrass production sites in eastern Canada indicated that average DM yields in Quebec City and Fredericton (9.6 and 9.7 t ha−1, respectively) were significantly lower than average DM yields in Saint-Hubert, Ottawa, and London (10.8, 10.4, and 11.0 t ha−1, respectively). Average annual production costs per tonne of DM for the spring harvest were higher at low-yield sites (CAD$66.67 and $64.50 for Fredericton and Quebec City, respectively) than at high-yield sites ($60.10, $62.82, and $60.08 for Saint-Hubert, Ottawa, and London, respectively). The IFSM-estimated production costs were within the range of the calculated values reported in other agro-economic analyses conducted in Ontario and Quebec. © Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada 2019.

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. is a multipurpose species with high potential for use in feeding, medicine, industry and as biofuel. For commercial plantations, the effect of fertilization on its production has to be known. The aim of this work was to determine dry matter, yield, oil and protein content with and without oil, in Jatropha seeds, in plants to which three NPK fertilization treatments (high, normal and low dose; HD, ND and LD) plus one unfertilized control (C) were applied under a random complete blocks experimental design, with three replicates. Seed yield corresponded to the production of the whole annual cycle; the oil and protein with oil (PCA) and without oil (PSA) were quantified in seeds of each treatment by Soxhlet extraction with ethyl ether. At the end of the cycle, a complete plant (aerial and root biomass) was extracted in each treatment to determine total biomass. Seed yield was significantly higher in HD, without statistical difference with ND and LD, but different to T; fruit production increased 47.16% in HD with respect to C. There was no statistical difference in the oil content in the seed. The percentage of PCA and PSA in the treatments HD and ND was statistically superior to that in LD and C. Protein presented differences due to the oil extraction of oil, due to its concentration. Dry matter production was significantly higher in HD, where root and aerial biomass were 42.64% and 23.70% higher with respect to C. Harvest index in the best treatment was 6.59%. © 2019 Interciencia Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this work, we present the first continuous flow process to produce the tailored biofuel 2-butyltetrahydrofuran from renewable resources. In a two-step approach lignocellulose-derived furfuralacetone is first hydrogenated and then deoxygenated over commercial catalysts to form the desired product. Both reactions were studied independently in batch conditions. The transition to a continuous flow system was done and various parameters were tested in the miniplant. Both reactions were performed in a two-reactor-concept approach to yield the desired 2-butyltetrahydrofuran in a high yield directly from furfuralacetone. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - To reduce the concentration of hydrocarbon compounds, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides in exhaust gases and to increase the completeness of combustion when using biofuel, it is proposed to use heating of biofuel. On the basis of experimental studies, the optimal heating range of biofuel - from 115 to 120 °C. They are obtained the values of hourly and specific fuel consumption, carbon monoxide emissions, hydrocarbon compounds and nitrogen oxides depending on the engine load when working on diesel fuel of petroleum origin, biofuel without heating and with heating. It is established that when using biofuel without heating, depending on the engine load, the fuel consumption is in the range of 17.67 to 27.77% when compared to the performance of diesel fuel of petroleum origin. The use of biofuel with temperature 120 °C immediately before injection into the engine cylinders reduces the consumption of biofuel from 2.78 to 9.34% depending on the engine load. When using biofuel, emissions of hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen do not differ significantly from the emissions while engine operation with diesel fuel of petroleum origin, however, the emissions of carbon monoxide are reduced almost twice. The use of heating of biofuel immediately before injection into the engine cylinders is reduced fuel consumption that indicates a more complete combustion of high-molecular compounds of biofuel. © 2019, International Journal of Renewable Energy Research.

AB  - This study investigates technoeconomic performance of standalone biorefinery concepts that utilize hybrid organic solvent and steam explosion pretreatment technique. The assessments were made based on a mathematical process model developed in UniSim Design software using inhouse experimental data. The work was motivated by successful experimental applications of the hybrid pretreatment technique on lignocellulosic feedstocks that demonstrated high fractionation efficiency into a cellulose-rich, a hemicellulose-rich and lignin streams. For the biorefinery concepts studied here, the targeted final products were ethanol, organosolv lignin and hemicellulose syrup. Minimum ethanol selling price (MESP) and Internal rate of return (IRR) were evaluated as economic indicators of the investigated biorefinery concepts. Depending on the configuration, and allocating all costs to ethanol, MESP in the range 0.53-0.95 €/L were required for the biorefinery concepts to break even. Under the assumed ethanol reference price of 0.55 €/L, the corresponding IRR were found to be in the range -1.75-10.7%. Hemicellulose degradation and high steam demand identified as major sources of inefficiencies for the process and economic performance, respectively. Sensitivity of MESP and IRR towards the most influential technical, economic and market parameters performed. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Digestate and biochar can be land applied to sequester carbon and improve net primary productivity, but the achievable scale is tied to expected growth in bioenergy production and land available for application. We use an attributional life-cycle assessment approach to estimate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and carbon storage potential of biochar, digested solids, and composted digested solids generated from organic waste in California as a test case. Our scenarios characterize changes in organic waste production, bioenergy facility build-out, bioenergy byproduct quality, and soil response. Moderate to upper bound growth in the bioenergy sector with annual byproduct disposal over 100 years could provide a cumulative GHG offset of 50-400 MMTCO2 equiv, with an additional 80-300 MMTC sequestered in soils. This corresponds to net GHG mitigation over 100 years equivalent to 340-1500 MMTCO2 equiv (80-350% of California's annual emissions). In most scenarios, there is sufficient working land to apply all available biochar and digestate, although land becomes a constraint if the soil's rest time between applications increases from 5 to 15 years. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Transport ensures the flow of material flows and provides people with amenities, but transport is a major source of danger to people's health and life, due to the emission of harmful pollutants. The composition of the exhaust gases of internal combustion engines depends on the composition of the fuel in terms of its quality and the engine's technical state and mode of operation. There are over 200 chemical compounds in the car transport bombs, many of which are harmful to humans, biospheres. Transport emissions: carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), hydrocarbons, aldehydes, particular matters and so on. The listed pollutants cause global changes in atmospheres that contribute to the formation of ozone holes, global warming or flooding. The article will analyse the negative impact of transport on the environment and evaluate the hypothetical transport process using an electric truck in a steel pipe carriage.

AB  - --Fossil fuels were the main source of energy until a few decades ago. With the increasing need for energy and continuous exploitation of fossil fuels, the exploration of alternative energy sources has increased enormously. Over the last decade, the hybrid renewable energy sources (HRES) that consist of two or even more energy sources have become a promising alternative to meet the load demand, especially in remote areas. The modeling and integration of these HRES to grid and power management is complex although they are incorporated in a small scale around the world. Hence, this paper reviews the modeling of individual components of the HRES main solar PV, the wind, fuel cell (FC), hydro, micro turbines, and biogas along with back up sources such as ultracapacitors and power converting equipment. Other than that, the paper also reviews various grid connected power management techniques and standalone hybrid system, which will greatly help researchers, utility energy planners, and policy makers to focus on developing and implementing this renowned technology. © 2019, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

AB  - Present paper deals with preparation, characterization, and application of biodiesel (BD) prepared from corn oil by using transesterification process. As prepared corn BD is characterized by CHNS, FTIR, HNMR, and GC-MS analysis and its properties are compared with fossil diesel. Based on CHNS analysis of BD, high C/H ratio (1.898) and low O/C ratio (0.06445) is obtained and empirical formula of BD is CH1.898N0.000322S0.000047O0.06445. Four-stroke, single cylinder diesel engine coupled with hydraulic dynamometer is experimentally tested by blending mixture (BM) of variable BD composition of BD with fossil diesel. Based on diesel engine performance, among the seven different blended mixtures of BD, BM containing 25% BD is the most efficient composition of BD in BM at all loading conditions (1–5 kg). © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Treatments consisted of distilled methyl ester (biodiesel) of babassu (Orbinya martiana) and seven combinations of it with two standard diesel fuels (B S1800 and B S50). The blending ratios were 0, 5, 15, 25, 50, and 100% biodiesel in diesel oil (B0, B5, B15, B25, B50, and B100, respectively). Regarding the results for hourly volumetric consumption, no difference was found between B0 and B100 when using B S1800, whereas an 8% increase was observed when using the S50. The weighted hourly consumption increased by 11.29 and 16.9% from B0 to B100 using B S1800 and B S50, respectively. Similarly, the specific fuel consumption increased by 11.1% and 14.3% from B0 to B100 using B S1800 and B S50, respectively. Yet, when comparing B0 and B S1800, the smoke density reduction was 68.6% and between B S50 and B100 was 58.0%. Our findings show that babassu biodiesel is a suitable substitute for diesel oil, without causing any damage to the tractor's engine. © Southern Cross Publishing-Australia 2007-2019.

AB  - Iran is the fourth biggest producer of crude oil and natural gas in the world. Meanwhile, this country is the largest CO2 emitter among the Middle East countries and 99% of energy in this country is produced from nonrenewable-based resources. Nevertheless, Iran has a promising potential to generate energy from its renewable resources such as biomass. Therefore, renewable energy generation can contribute to increasing the renewable energy share in the country’s energy generation and mitigating the environmental impacts. Thus, the aim of this research was to evaluate the second generation biofuel production potential in Guilan province (as one of the important agricultural areas in the region) of Iran. In this research, energy generation from cow manure, poultry manure, municipal solid wastes, rice wastes, and peanut wastes were studied. The results showed that the total energy generation from second-generation biomass resources in Guilan province of Iran was 76,523,985.50 GJ year−1. The yearly potential of energy generation from cow manure, poultry manure, municipal solid wastes, rice wastes, and peanut wastes were 2,284,529, 352,138, 648,523, 73,238,768, and 27 GJ, respectively. In conclusion, there is a remarkable potential to generate energy from second-generation biomass resources in Guilan province of Iran. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - It is evident from the past investigations that the biodiesel improves the quality of combustion and elevates the thermal efficiency. But the inevitable fact that enhanced combustion quality enhances NOx emissions. This works aims at decreasing NOx emissions by changing the injector hole number (IHN) so that the wall impingement may be reduced which would reduce the NOx emissions. The experiments are conducted for three different nozzle configurations (four holes, five holes, and six holes) for three different kapok methyl ester blends (20%, 30%, and 40%) for three loads. The Performance and emission parameters are optimized using a 3*3*3 matrix (load, biofuel blend, and IHN). As expected results indicate reduction of NOx with increase in IHN. CO, HC, and smoke also see a mild decrement with increase in IHN. Brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) decreases with increase in IHN whereas slight increase of BSFC is observed with increase of fuel blend. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In this study, the use of liquid-phase plasma discharge (LPPD) technology to accelerate the transesterification process was explored. An innovative LPPD reactor was first evaluated by varying the conductive opening size on the dielectric plate (0.75, 1.0, and 1.25 mm) coupled with five methanol to oil molar ratios (MOMR; 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7) and two liquid flowrates through the reactor (2.7 and 4.1 mL s-1) at a given catalyst (NaOH) to oil ratio (NaOR) of 0.8% (w/w). The optimal combination of opening size (1.0 mm), MOMR (5), and flowrate (2.7 mL s-1) was then fixed while the NaOR was varied from 0.4% to 1.2% (w/w) in 0.2% increments to determine the best NaOR for the reactor. The results showed that the best combination of the four operating parameters was an opening size of 1.0 mm, MOMR of 5, liquid flowrate of 2.7 mL s-1, and NaOR of 0.6% (w/w), with which a biodiesel conversion rate of 99.5% was obtained at an applied voltage of 1.2 kV. The transesterification reaction time was found to be only 923 ms. The developed LPPD technology has potential to position biodiesel competitively against petroleum diesel. © 2019 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers

AB  - The feasibility of utilizing corn straws to produce butanol via fermentation with Clostridium acetobutylicum was evaluated. The supernatant of enzymatically hydrolyzed supernatant of steam-exploded corn straws was used as the raw material. A bacterial strain was selected from Clostridium acetobutylicum zzu-02 and Clostridium beijerinckii zzu-01, which was capable of fermenting the enzymatically hydrolyzed supernatant of steam-exploded corn straw to produce butanol with high yield. The optimal fermentation conditions for the selected strain with enzymatically hydrolyzed supernatant of steam-exploded corn straw were also investigated and they were determined as follows: sugar concentrations in enzymatically hydrolyzed solution of steam exploded corn straws, 57.5 g/L; initial pH, 6.3; the amount of added CaCO3, 5g/L; the bacterial inoculation concentration to enzymatically hydrolyzed solution, 6%; fermentation temperature, 37 °C, the amounts of the added nutritional elements, i.e. yeast extract, CH3COONH4, KH2PO4, and C6H6N2O, 0.8, 6.0, 0.5, and 0.25 g/L, respectively. Under these conditions, the butanol yield reached 9.88 g/L. Based on the butanol metabolism pathways, supplementation of a small amount of C6H6N2O was found to effectively increase the yield of butanol production. © 2018, BioResources.

AB  - Wastes from lignocellulosic materials, especially hemicellulose, are extremely promising resources to produce fuels from renewable raw materials. Furfural, resulting from the depolymerization of hemicellulose, is often considered as an extremely interesting platform molecule. Particularly, new biofuels containing molecules with 8 and 13 carbon atoms can be produced from aldol condensation of furfural and acetone followed by a deoxygenation reaction. In this work, several magnesium hydroxide fluorides MgF2-x(OH)x were prepared by a sol-gel method with various F/Mg ratios (0 to 2) at 100 °C. All solid samples were fully characterized by several techniques (nitrogen adsorption-desorption, TEM, IR, XRD and ICP). MgF2-x(OH)x were mainly composed of an intimate mixture of MgF2 and Mg(OH)2-x(OCH3)x and exhibited both acid-base properties and high surface areas. From CO2 adsorption experiments, a basicity scale corresponding to basic sites with moderate strength was established: MgF1.5(OH)0.5 &gt; MgF(OH) ∼ MgF1.75(OH)0.25 &gt; MgF0.5(OH)1.5 &gt; Mg(OH)2 ≫ MgF2. It was proposed that the presence of fluorine allowed stabilization of the basic sites with moderate strength at ambient atmosphere. The aldol condensation of furfural and acetone was carried out under mild reaction conditions (50 °C, Patm) over MgF2-x(OH)x. These catalysts were involved in this reaction without using a classical activation step for basic solid catalysts, which constitutes a major advantage of energy conservation and thus, economic efficiency. The solid with a F/Mg ratio equal to 1.5 (MgF1.5(OH)0.5) exhibited the highest activity, the furanic dimer (1,5-di(furan-2-yl)penta-1,4-dien-3-one) being the main product. A good correlation between the catalytic activity and the basicity scale was highlighted. Based on these results, the nature of active sites was proposed: a combination of a Lewis acid site (coordinatively unsaturated metal site) in the vicinity of a basic site (hydroxyl groups of Mg(OH)2-x(OCH3)x). The effect of the furfural/acetone ratio on the catalytic properties of MgF1.5(OH)0.5 was also investigated. This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The inappropriate disposal of millions of tons of domestically produced used cooking oil (UCO), either down domestic household drains or in landfill, causes significant detrimental effects on the environment but also constitutes the loss of a valuable resource, since used cooking oil is a sought-after feedstock for biodiesel production. This paper presents findings from a social reverse logistics system, called InnovOleum, for collecting and recycling domestic used cooking oil through schools. The disruptive, social aspect of InnovOleum derives from the provision of funds from the sale of the collected used cooking oil to be invested within the participating schools in ongoing environmental education and green infrastructure and technology. To date, over 200,000 Euros have been distributed to schools for this purpose. No other schemes with similar potential to fully harness the environmental and social benefits from the collection and conversion of domestically produced used cooking oil have been found in literature. This publication can therefore significantly contribute to the knowledge base and facilitate the transfer of this scheme elsewhere. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The demand for renewable energy sources such as waste pyrolysis plastic oil (WPPO), ethanol biofuel with high oxygen content is increasing globally. This study used blending of conventional diesel oil, waste plastic pyrolysis oil, ethanol and 2-ethyl hexyl nitrate (EHN) as additive. The purpose was to improve combustion, the ignition quality, and performance and emission characteristics of WPPO as an alternative source of energy. As an additive EHN reduces emissions of CO, CO2, UHC, NOX, and PM. On the other hand, the inclusion of ethanol purposed to improve the viscosity, increase the oxygen content of the blends, and increase miscibility of WPPO. The study utilized the following ratios, 50/WPPO25/E25, 60/WPPO20/E20, 70/WPPO15/E15, 80/WPPO10/E10 and 90/WPPO5/E5 for conventional diesel (CD), WPPO and ethanol and EHN respectively. The ratio of the additive was determined by the percentage method based on the total quantity of the blended fuel and was calculated as 0.001 %. A complete Miscibility was observed to avoid phase separation during the study and experimentation, for the blended ratios of WPPO. The testing for performance and emission characteristics was conducted on a fixed bed, water-cooled, single cylinder diesel generator engine. The results were compared to ASTM standards and discussed using tables and figures. The results conclusively show very close densities of 792 kg/m3, 963 kg/m3, 825 kg/m3 for WPPO, ethanol, EHN respectively, which are close to CD fuel at 845 kg/m3. Increased blend ratio decreased BSFC, 50 % engine load blend 80/WPPO10/E10 had values of 0.043 g/kW.h compared to full load with 0.041 g/kW.h. The highest brake thermal efficiency was by blend 90/WPPO5/E5 at 25 % engine load with a value of 26.5 % compared to 19 % at full engine load. Increase in the blend ratio and engine load decreased CO emissions up to 75 % engine load. For example, blend 90/WPPO5/E5 had a value of 0.035 % carbon emissions compared to 0.055 % at 25 % engine load. Therefore, conclusively WPPO blends can be alternative fuel with or without major engine modification. © 2019 ASTES Publishers. All rights reserved.

AB  - The corrosion inhibition effect of Nepalese origin plant of Vitex negundo leaf extract on the passivation behavior of aluminum and copper was studied in pure biodiesel (B100) produced from waste cooking oil and its 10% blend with 90% petrodiesel (B10) at 25±2°C in airtight glass bottle using immersion tests, inhibition efficiency and anodic polarization measurements. The corrosion rate of the aluminum and copper metals was decreased with increasing the concentrations of the methanolic fraction of the plant extract up to 2000 ppm in both the B100 and B10 biofuels. The V. negundo extract showed the maximum corrosion inhibition efficiency of about 83% in both B100 and B10 for aluminum metal and its maximum inhibition efficiency for copper metal was found about 96% and 60% in B100 and B10, respectively. The phenomena of such high corrosion inhibition action of V. negundo plant extract to aluminum and copper metals in both B100 and B10 is mostly explained by the adsorption process of the plant extract on the surface of both metals which obeyed the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. It was found that additions of different concentrations of plant extracts in both B100 and B10 acted as mixed and anodic type corrosion inhibitor for copper and aluminum, respectively, based on the results of immersion and polarization tests. Consequently, it can be said that the V. negundo leaf extract can be used as an efficient and environmentally friendly corrosion inhibitor so as to control the corrosion of copper significantly in pure biodiesel as compared to aluminum in B100 and B10 as well as to copper in B10 at room temperature in airtight condition. © 2019, Russian Association of Corrosion Engineers.

AB  - Background &amp; Objective: Crude glycerol (Glol), used as substrate for screening eleven natural Yarrowia lipolytica strains in shake-flask experiments. Aim of this study was to assess the ability of the screened strains to produce biomass (dry cell weight; X), lipid (L), citric acid (Cit), mannitol (Man), arabitol (Ara) and erythritol (Ery), compounds presenting pharmaceutical and biotechnological interest, in glycerol-based nitrogen-limited media, in which initial glycerol concentration had been adjusted to 40 g/L. Methods: Citric acid may find use in biomedical engineering (i.e. drug delivery, tissue engineering, bi-oimaging, orthopedics, medical device coating, wound dressings). Polyols are considered as compounds with non-cariogenic and less calorigenic properties as also with low insulin-mediated response. Microbial lipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are medically and dietetically important (selective pharmaceutical and anticancer properties, aid fetal brain development, the sight function of the eye, hormonal balance and the cardio-vascular system, prevent reasons leading to type-2 diabetes, present healing and anti-inflammatory effects). Results: All strains presented satisfactory microbial growth (Xmax=5.34-6.26 g/L) and almost complete substrate uptake. The principal metabolic product was citric acid (Citmax=8.5-31.7 g/L). Production of cellular lipid reached the values of 0.33-0.84 g/L. Polyols were also synthesized as strain dependent compounds (Manmax =2.8-6.1 g/L, Aramax ~2.0 g/L, Erymax= 0.5-3.8 g/L). The selected Y. lipolytica strain ACA-DC 5029 presented satisfactory growth along with synthesis of citric acid and polyols, thus, was further grown on media presenting an increased concentration of Glol~75 g/L. Biomass, lipid and citric acid production presented significant enhancement (Xmax=11.80 g/L, Lmax=1.26 g/L, Citmax=30.8 g/L), but conversion yield of citric acid produced per glycerol consumed was decreased compared to screening trials. Erythritol secretion (Erymax=15.6 g/L) was highly favored, suggesting a shift of yeast metabolism from citric acid accumulation towards erythritol production. Maximum endo-polysaccharides (IPS) concentration was 4.04 g/L with yield in dry weight 34.2 % w/w. Conclusion: Y. lipolytica strain ACA-YC 5029 can be considered as a satisfactory candidate grown in high concentrations of crude glycerol to produce added-value compounds that interest pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. © 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - This work presents the results of a supercritical transesterification process of soybean oil using methanol, performed in a laboratory high pressure semi-batch reactor. A full description of the equipment and a standard operating procedure are also provided. Since fossil fuels are not renewable, biofuels such biodiesel, have gained attention over the past decades. Biodiesel is the result of the transesterification of triacylglycerols in vegetable oils or animal fats and it works as an alternative fuel for compression-ignition engines. Methanol was chosen to perform the reaction, at molar ratios of 1:24 (oil: alcohol) and 0.1 (CO2:methanol), temperature of 280 °C and pressure of 130 bar. In order to decrease the reaction time, CO2 in the supercritical state was used as cosolvent. The yield of biodiesel produced was equal to 95.19% in only ten minutes of reaction. A high yield of methyl esters (84.41%) was detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In general, 10 compounds were identified. The component in higher concentration was linoleate, followed by methyl hexadecanoate, oleic acid methyl ester and methyl stearate. The ester conversion rate means that the process with supercritical methanol can be successfully applied to produce biodiesel. © 2019, Sociedade Brasileira de Ciencia e Tecnologia de Alimentos, SBCTA.

AB  - In the article, a qualitative and quantitative analysis of motor biofuels for water and land types of transport is carried out. In that context, the possibility of increasing their efficiency is demonstrated through the introduction of the rapid pyrolysis process, which allows up to 25% of renewable fuels to be used in a mixture with conventional diesel. It is established that the most effective way is the joint processing of bio-oil with oil products on existing production facilities, which does not require the construction of new plants, significantly reduces the dependence on fossil oil, and the obtained gasoline and diesel fuel have good performance characteristics and their use practically does not require changes in the fuel consumption infrastructure. © 2019, University of Dubronvnik.

AB  - Three unconventional herbaceous energy plants – sida (Sida hermaphrodita Rusby), elephant grass (Miscanthus giganteus) and reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea) – were grown and investigated in the experimental fields of Aleksandras Stulginskis University, and the technical means of plant preparation and usage for energy purposes were investigated. The physical-mechanical characteristics (moisture content, density, flow angles) of chopped and milled unconventional energy plants were investigated. These characteristics are required to project and choose the supply, transportation and storage equipment. In evaluating the quality of plant chopping and milling, the fractional compositions of reed canary grass, sida and elephant grass chaff as well as the mill were determined. The largest chaff fraction was found in a sieve with 8-mm diameter holes (from 52.0 to 62.7%), and the largest mill fraction was found in a sieve with 0.5-and 0.63-mm diameter holes (from 37.6 to 46.4%). The pellet moisture content was sufficiently low and varied from 6.7% to 9.6%. The highest density was determined in reed canary grass pellets (1035.1±63.9 kg m-3 DM), and the lowest density was in elephant grass pellets (653.6±67.1 kg m-3 DM). The emission of harmful gases was determined when various unconventional energy plants were burned. The highest concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) was observed when burning elephant grass (2294.7 ppm), and the smallest concentration of CO was observed when burning reed canary grass (905.2 ppm). The most carbon dioxide was detected when burning sida (7.9%), and the smallest when burning elephant grass (5.2%). The nitrogen oxide emissions differed only insignificantly; the values ranged from 176.2 ppm (Reed canary grass) to 216.1 ppm (Elephant grass). The production of granules, when biomass was not dried artificially in a dryer, was calculated to have a prime cost of 0.12 EUR/kg. When energetic grasses were dried using dispergation, the primary cost increases to 0.13 EUR/kg. © 2019, HARD Publishing Company. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper deepens the study on fuel evaporation in a modern internal combustion engine fed with commercial diesel fuel and the biofuel rapeseed methyl ester (RME) by modeling and infrared diagnostics. A one-dimensional (1D) model has been coupled to experimental results of infrared imaging measurements carried out in a research compression ignition engine equipped with the head of a commercial diesel engine. Images of the in-cylinder processes have been recorded at different crank angles through the optical access in the piston. An infrared band-pass filter has been used to isolate the fuel vapor phase (3.4 µm) and to analyze the spatial evolution and concentration of fuel in the combustion chamber. On the other hand, a 1D model of fuel injection has been implemented to calculate the instantaneous fuel vapor mass and the evaporation rate. The energy required for the vaporization of the fuel and its contribution to the calculated rate of heat release in the cylinder has been evaluated. Model results of fuel concentration inside the jet structure are in line with qualitative infrared data. A slower evaporation rate has been estimated for RME and a correspondence between the peak of evaporation rate and the IR signal has been noted. © 2019 by Begell House, Inc.

AB  - Biodiesel can replace diesel because it possesses similar physicochemical properties and has many advantages. However, this biofuel, due to the nature of the raw material used in its production, is susceptible to oxidation, hence the need to apply antioxidant substances. The antioxidant options and varieties are many, but synthetic antioxidants like tertbutylhydroquinone (TBHQ), butylhydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylhydroxytoluene (BHT) are the most widely used. The aim of the present work was to present multiple linear regression mathematical models to express the antioxidant protection capacity of the oxidation reaction through the relative protection factor, using as independent variables the biodiesel compliance parameters. These models were suitable for predictive purposes with coefficients of determination (R2) and adjusted (R2 aju) varying between 0.88 and 0.93 and values of p lower than 0.05 besides the low dispersion between the predicted and observed values. Through the level curves, using the most significant independent variables, it was possible to analyze the behavior of the relative protection factor. The optimization of the mathematical models, containing only the significant terms, presented FPR of 120.11 for TBHQ, 30.05 for BHT and 41.52 for BHA. © 2019 Sociedade Brasileira de Quimica.

AB  - Soot and black carbon (BC) particles are generated in the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, biomass, and biofuels. These airborne particles affect air quality, human health, aerosol-cloud interactions, precipitation formation, and climate. At present, the climate effects of BC particles are not well understood. Their role in cloud formation is obscured by their chemical and physical variability and by the internal mixing states of these particles with other compounds. Ice nucleation in field studies is often difficult to interpret. Nonetheless, most field studies seem to suggest that BC particles are not efficient ice-nucleating particles (INPs). On the other hand, laboratory measurements show that in some cases, BC particles can be highly active INPs under certain conditions. By working with well-characterized BC particles, our aim is to systematically establish the factors that govern the ice nucleation activity of BC. The current study focuses on laboratory measurements of the effectiveness of BC-containing aerosol in the formation of ice crystals in temperature and ice supersaturation conditions relevant to cirrus clouds. We examine ice nucleation on BC particles under watersubsaturated cirrus cloud conditions, commonly understood as deposition-mode ice nucleation. We study a series of wellcharacterized commercial carbon black particles with varying morphologies and surface chemistries as well as ethylene flame-generated combustion soot. The carbon black particles used in this study are proxies for atmospherically relevant BC aerosols. These samples were characterized by electron microscopy, mass spectrometry, and optical scattering measurements. Ice nucleation activity was systematically examined in temperature and saturation conditions in the ranges of 217 ≤ T ≤ 235 K and 1:0 ≤ Sice ≤ 1:5 and 0:59 ≤ Swater ≤ 0:98, respectively, using a SPectrometer for Ice Nuclei (SPIN) instrument, which is a continuous-flow diffusion chamber coupled with instrumentation to measure light scattering and polarization. To study the effect of coatings on INPs, the BC-containing particles were coated with organic acids found in the atmosphere, namely stearic acid, cis-pinonic acid, and oxalic acid. The results show significant variations in ice nucleation activity as a function of size, morphology, and surface chemistry of the BC particles. The measured ice nucleation activity dependencies on temperature, supersaturation conditions, and the physicochemical properties of the BC particles are consistent with an ice nucleation mechanism of pore condensation followed by freezing. Coatings and surface oxidation modify the initial formation efficiency of pristine ice crystals on BC-containing aerosol. Depending on the BC mate rial and the coating, both inhibition and enhancement in INP activity were observed. Our measurements at low temperatures complement published data and highlight the capability of some BC particles to nucleate ice under low ice supersaturation conditions. These results are expected to help refine theories relating to soot INP activation in the atmosphere. © 2019 Author(s).

AB  - Currently, biodiesel produced from algae is receiving a positive response as a substitute for conventional base diesel. To cope up from the costs of expensive downstream stages in the production of biodiesel from algae, present investigation is conducted using algae growing in wastewater as lipid source for biodiesel production. The in situ transesterification using algae was carried to optimize the effect of reaction parameters on the biodiesel yield. The parameters studied were: temperature (35-75 ºC), algae biomass (wt.) to methanol (vol.) ratio (1:1-1:6), catalyst concentration (25-100 wt. %) and stirring intensity (150-750 rpm). The optimum conditions for maximum biodiesel yield achieved were: catalyst concentration and algae biomass to methanol ratio were 60 % and 1:4, respectively with stirring intensity of 450 rpm at 55 ºC. The gas chromatographic studies and fuel properties of biodiesel also establish its potential to be used as fuel in existing engines in accordance to American and European standards. © 2019 Chemical Publishing Co..

AB  - The performance of mixtures of petrodiesel, palm biodiesel and refined copaiba oleoresin as fuel in an electric generator is analyzed. Tests were carried out in a power plant provided with a secondary feeding system to monitor the performance of the mixtures and of the reference fuel under full load conditions. Influence of percentage of oleoresin in mixtures on fuel consumption, power delivered and emission of exhaust gases were studied. A decrease of up to 19% was established in power generated by plant with respect to energy supplied by the diesel-operated engine. In relation to gases emission, the addition of refined copaiba oleoresin to fuel, reduces concentration of CO and SO2 in exhaust gases. According to the results, incorporation of copaiba oleoresin to commercial diesel could be an environmentally friendly option. However, increase in viscosity of fuel could limit its use in automotive applications. © 2019 Centro de Informacion Tecnologica. All rights reserved.

AB  - Agro-industrial wastes are abundant and low-cost sources of energy and chemicals. Biomass account for 14% of the world’s energy production. Industrial residues of production of soluble coffee (spent coffee grounds - SCG) have great potential due to its large-scale production and can be transformed by pyrolysis, in liquid, solid and gaseous products with applications from energy to chemicals. This work has the objective of producing bio-oil from the pyrolysis of industrial SCG, characterize it by chromatography and indicate its possible applications. As SGC contains a large amount of glycerides, they were extracted from SGC before the pyrolysis, aiming to obtain a better bio-oil from the residue. The yield in vegetable oil was 5.2% and its analyses showed that 50% are saturated acids (mainly palmitic 27.6%) and other 50% are unsaturated ones (mainly linoleic acid 35.3%). This composition qualifies this oil for biodiesel purposes. The residue (SGC after extraction) was submitted to pyrolysis, yielding 30% in liquid products, being 6% bio-oil. The bio-oil was analyzed by gas chromatography being identified free fatty acids, hydrocarbons, phenols and N-compounds. The heteroatomic compounds limit the use as biofuel but can be interesting for the pharmaceutical, agrochemical and fine chemicals industries. © 2019 Sociedade Brasileira de Quimica.

AB  - Production of energy from lignocellulosic biomass using internal combustion engines (ICE) is desirable, provided that costs can be reduced. The recalcitrance of lignocellulosic biomass requires additional treatments for second-generation biofuel conversion processes, falling short of sustainability goals and profit margins. Rather than transforming solid biomass to liquid or gaseous fuels through multistep processes, this paper explores the direct use of biomass powder below 200 μm in an engine. Reducing biofuel production to a single milling process offers the chance to downscale biofuel production for implementation at the local level, through standalone or hybrid installations with other renewable energies. In scenarios using intermittent energies such as solar or wind, production of biomass powder can be operated during low demand periods to store surplus energy which can be later used for generating power on demand. To test the feasibility of this concept, four biomasses (rice husk, chestnut wood, pine bark, and wheat straw) were micronised to an average particle size of 20 μm and fuelled in an instrumented ICE. Our results confirm that an ICE can start and run with various biomass types at a wide range of operating regimes without any assistance. During these tests, efficiencies up to 17.5% were observed with powdered rice husk, using an intake temperature of 40 °C. Emissions (CO, NOx, and SO2) were found to be within acceptable operating limits of available aftertreatment technologies. This first assessment of the compared combustion behaviour of different biomass powders in ICE highlights the fact that the challenges associated with this alternative biofuel demand a cross-disciplinary approach from research domains such as dust explosion prevention, biomass combustion and engine technology. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - We assess the welfare implications of a revenue-neutral tax in the presence of two Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) policies for cellulosic biofuels: the waiver credit and the input-ratio requirement. We extend the model of revenue-neutral taxation to allow for the taxation of a dirty input in an imperfectly competitive market while integrating RFS-specific policies. Simulations from Washington and Oregon indicate that a revenue-neutral tax raises welfare by 19%–21% but growth in cellulosic ethanol production is minimal, ranging from 0.6% to 1.5%. Pollution taxes, cellulosic ethanol production, and welfare are more responsive to the waiver credit than to the input-ratio requirement. Copyright © 2019 Western Agricultural Economics Association.

AB  - Today’s growing demand for energy has emphasized the need for the search for renewable resources. This demand can be met with by using alternative resources such as biofuel, rather than just depending on non-renewable resources. Therefore, the present study has been undertaken to extract lipid from a species of Bryophyta, i.e. Marchantia polymorpha. 0.044 g of lipid was extracted from 8 g of the bryophyte. Bligh and Dyer method was used for the extraction of lipid. It is a multi-step process in which methanol, chloroform, and NaCl play an important role in the extraction of bioproduct in the form of oily bodies. This small step taken towards energy utilization and conservation will open the new vista to mitigate the problem of energy crisis. © 2019 Technoscience Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - Microalgae have been recognized as powerful phototrophic cell-factories whose applications range from biomass production for food and feed purposes to the production of high-value products and biofuels. Microalgae have been considered a source of functional ingredients, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids, polysaccharides, essential minerals, vitamins and bioactive peptides that can have positive effects on human and animal health. Besides having high nutritional value due to the high percentage of proteins in their composition, microalgae generate high-value products, such as pigments, polysaccharides, bio-hydrogen, and even bio-polyesters with plastic-like properties. Algal biomass that remains after product recovery can be used as forage, biofertilizer or feedstock for biogas production. This step in overall algal production is important from an economic point of view due to the reduction in production costs. This paper presents the detailed study of the biotechnologically most important microalgae strains, and the design principles of photobioreactors for their cultivation. In addition, the main existing and potential high-value products derivable from microalgae, as well as utilization of microalgae for phytoremediation and biogas production, were reviewed. © 2019 Assoc. of Chemists and Chemical Engineers of Croatia.

AB  - The paper deals with a topical issue of using biofuels in internal combustion engines. Promising biofuels may be derived from vegetable oils. In agriculture, using blends of petroleum fuel and a moderate amount of vegetable oil is economically feasible. We consider rapeseed oil and sunflower oil as these possible additives. We list physical and chemical properties of vegetable oils and blends of vegetable oils and diesel fuel. We analysed the experimental investigation results concerning the D-245.12S diesel engine running on petroleum fuel and its blends with vegetable oil additives specified above. We demonstrate that it is possible to improve environmental performance of a diesel by using these biofuel blends. We present a method for optimising the composition of petroleum fuel blends with vegetable oil additives that is based on determining a generalised optimality criterion as a sum of partial optimality criteria charac-terising regulated toxic component content in diesel exhaust gas emissions. We used the method presented to perform optimisation calculations and determine the optimum composition for biofuel blends with vegetable oil additives. We developed a method for estimating environmental safety of diesel power plants that takes into account the concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the diesel exhaust gases. We show that knowing benzo[a]pyrene emission levels of a diesel running on a specific type of fuel is enough to estimate the degree of environmental threat of its exhaust gases. © Author(s), 2019

AB  - Aim:The present study was conducted to optimise the production of biodiesel from goat tallow by chemical andbiologicaltransesterificationandtoanalysethefuelcharacteristicsofbiodiesel. Methodology: Lipid from goat tallow was extracted after subjecting the tallow to ultrasonication and microwaveheating.Thelipidobtainedwasconvertedtobiodieselbychemicalandbiologicaltransesterification processes. Results: Microwave heating of goat tallow with hexane produced 550 ml of oil whereas ultrasonication method produced 350 ml and 430 ml with Hexane and Hexane: Isopropanol (3:2) as solvent mixture, respectively. When one litre of this oil was subjected to transesterification reaction, 750 ml and 640 ml of biodiesel was produced by chemical and biological methods under optimized conditions (temperature 60oC for chemical and 35oC for biological transesterification). GC-MS analysis of transesterified oil indicated linolenic acid, pentadecanoic acid and stearic acid as major lipid components in goat tallow. Fuel properties were tested as perASTM standards. Interpretation: The biological process (either with the enzyme or with organism), if properly designed can definitely be an advantageous as this process is cost effective and environmental friendly. Goat tallow can be a potential candidate for the nline production of biodiesel, an alternate to fossil fuel, which is the need of the hour. © Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India)

AB  - Ccphalaria syriaca (Turkish Pelemir) seed oil is edible oil which is not used as cooking oil our coun-try. The current work it was aimed to maximize the yields of biodiescl production from Pelemir seed oil (PSO) by using the grey based taguchi method and at the same time to keep the kinematic viscosity values between the nominal limits. This study presents joined effect of four input parameters (factors) such as catalyst concentration (A), molar ratio of oil to methanol (molar ratio) (B), reaction temperature (C) and reaction time (D) in controlling two significant performance parameters (responses) yields of biodiescl (yi) and kinematic viscosity (y:). Orthogonal array was used for the design of experiments on the principle of L9. Taguchi technique was coupled with grey relational analysis to obtain a grey relational grade for evaluating multiple outputs. Grey relational analysis in the Taguchi technique was employed for determining the best combination values of input parameters. It was found that A1B3C3D3 (0.5%, 12:1,60°C, 80 min) optimal parametric combination. © 2019 Parlar Scientific Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biodiesel as a fuel has become more preferred due to its environmental benefits and the fact that it is made from renewable resources. Waste coking oil (WCO) is the residue oil generated during food or semi-product preparation by frying and cooking. It is tremendous in the houses and restaurants, so the technical disposal of it becomes necessary. In this study, WCO containing low free fatty acids (FFA) was used as raw material for methyl ester (biodiesel) production. As a result of trances terification, the optimum conditions for methyl ester production can be determined by changing the basic parameters (factors) affecting product yield. This scope of study, the effects of catalyst amount, reaction temperature and molar ratio of alcohol to oil (molar ratio) parameters on the yield of waste cooking oil methyl ester (WCOME) was determined. For this purpose, experiments were carried out at reaction temperatures of 40 °C, 50 °C and 60 °C; 0.5, 1, and 1.5% catalyst amount at 4:1, 6:1, 8:1, and 10:1 molar ratios using KOH catalyst. ANOVA (Analysis of variance) was used for optimizing the parameters used in methyl ester production. After ANOVA, Tukey HSD multiple comparison test was used as a more realistic awareness resource for the determination of optimal production parameters and levels. © 2019 Parlar Scientific Publications.

AB  - Concerning the growing need for energy resources and reduction of fossil fuels, researchers seek for the use and development of biofuels. Among the biofuels, biodiesel has captured the attention of researchers since it deals with the oil cost and embraces environmental benefits. Aiming at continuous and optimal biodiesel production, the current study examines the effects of the residence time of hydrodynamic reactors, catalyst concentration, methanol-to-oil ratio, and ultrasound power on methyl esters yield. To optimize the transesterification reaction of the waste oil, the response surface method was used. Results of the study indicated that the increase of residence time results in an increase of the methyl esters yield, but following the time up to 90 s, the methyl esters yield decreases. The increase of catalyst by 1% leads to the increase of the methyl esters yield, and up to 1.25% the catalyst concentration, the methyl esters yield decreases by 7%. The increase of methanol-to-oil ratio up to 6:1 results in an increase of yield, and up to 8:1 methanol-to-oil ratio, the methyl esters yield follows an increasing trend with a slight slope. The optimal conditions in this study were 60 s residence time, 1% catalyst concentration, 6:1 methanol-to-oil ratio, and 250W ultrasound power, and that the methyl esters yield, as well as the consumed energy, were obtained 90.45% and 21.52 kJ, respectively. In conclusion, the suggested method is suitable for biodiesel production based on the methyl esters yield and energy consumption. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The production of biofuels and chemicals by hydrogenation of furfural has attracted much attention recently. Herein the effect of Na+ doping on the catalytic performance of Pd/SiO2 in hydrogenation and reductive-etherification of furfural in ethanol was systematically studied. Two Pd/SiO2 catalysts with and without the modification by Na+ were prepared by impregnation and calcination. Their catalytic properties were compared for the hydrogenation of furfural and furfural diethyl acetal under mild conditions. The silanol groups on Pd/SiO2 catalysed the acetalization of furfural and alcohol and the resulted acetal underwent hydrogenolysis on Pd nanoparticles (NPs) with an average particle size of 8 nm, leading to a moderate yield (∼58%) of furfuryl ethyl ether. Doping Na+ on Pd/SiO2 led to the diminishing of silanol groups as well as strong interaction between Na+ and Pd NPs. No acetalization occurred on Na+ modified Pd/SiO2 due to the exchange of H+ of Si-OH with Na+, thus the reductive etherification of CO group in furfural was completely inhibited. Meanwhile the hydrogenation of furan-ring over Na+ coordinated Pd NPs could proceed with very high selectivity (&gt;90%) forming tetrahydrofurfural in high yield. Kinetics study on the hydrogenation of furfural diethyl acetal over Pd/SiO2 and Na+ doped Pd/SiO2 suggested that the Na+ greatly impeded the hydrogenolysis of C-O-C bond of acetal, while the hydrogenation of the furan ring took place selectively.

AB  - This paper reports an investigation of the use of biodiesel in a common rail direct injection (CRDI) engine. Experiments were carried out on a CRDI engine powered with diesel and biodiesel to investigate the effect of injectors with different numbers of holes on its performance. CRDI operation resulted in a better brake thermal efficiency (BTE) with a 7-hole injector for both fuels and injection strategies adopted. The HC, CO, and smoke emissions were reduced, but NOx emissions were higher for both fuels. It was seen that the ID and CD of honge oil methyl ester (HOME) were higher than those of the diesel. But, the ID was found to be lower at 100% load compared to 80% load, and on the other hand, the CD was higher at 100% load compared to 80% load. Also, a 7-hole injector resulted in a lower ID and CD as compared to a 6-hole injector. The diesel- and HOME-powered CRDI engine with the 7-hole injector yielded a 6% to 11% lower ID and a 15% to 19% lower CD as compared to the CI mode. PP and peak HRR of the HOME were also lower. The 7-hole injector resulted in a higher PP and HRR for all fuels due to the better air-fuel mixing. Discrete or multiple or split and single point injections were adopted for biodiesels at 900 bar IP and IT of 10° BTDC using the 7-hole injector. The split injection of HOME adopted with a 40-30-30 combination resulted in a slightly higher BTE compared to the 40-20-40 combination. However, both single and discrete or multiple injections adopted showed improved fuel consumption compared to single point injection and the poor performance of HOME in both the versions compared to the diesel engine. Hence, the multiple injection performance of biodiesels leans toward that of diesel. Multiple and single point injections were adopted for biodiesels at different injection opening pressures and a fixed IT of 10° BTDC for 80% loading, and it was found that BTE was slightly higher at 900 bar for all fuels. The split injection of HOME adopted with a 40-30-30 combination resulted in a slightly higher BTE compared to the 40-20-40 combination. Among all the injecting pressures tested, the highest BTE was noted for an IOP of 900 bar for a split injection of 40-30-30. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Microalgae are photosynthetic microorganisms that are studied due to the variety of metabolites that they produce. However, if cultivated in photobioreactors, these devices should be easy to scale up. Also, harvesting and drying the microalgal biomass should be economically viable at industrial scales. Based on this point of view, in this work a 1.5 L cylindrical-Conical photobioreactor was designed to cultivate and harvest the microalga Coelastrum sp. under nitrogen limitation. Maximum cell density was 23.47 × 106 cells mL-1. Biomass and lipid productivities after 5 days of nitrogen limitation were 266.24 mg L-1 d-1 and 137.51 mg L-1 d-1 respectively. A lipid content of 45.6% (w/w dry biomass) was attained. A sludge drying bed was also designed to dry the microalgal biomass. The retention filter used in the sludge drying bed allowed a cell retention efficiency of 86.8% and the final water content of the dried biomass was 7.82% ± 1.99 which allowed the lipid extraction without further drying. The lipid profile after transesterification of triacylglycerides was [C14:0 (3.04%), C16:0 (35.52%), C18:0 (42.50%), C18:1 (14.30%), C18:2 (4.63%)] which indicates that the lipid extract is more suitable for green diesel than biodiesel. © 2019, Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana Iztapalapa.

AB  - The current experimental work focuses on the influence of adding multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) with waste cooking oil methyl ester (WCME) on the performance, emission and combustion parameters of compression ignition engine. The MWCNT was scrutinized using TEM and XRD analysis, and then it was blended with waste cooking oil biodiesel fuel at a fraction of 25, 50, and 75 mg/L using ultrasonicator. These blends were tested under different engine loads and a constant speed of 2000 rpm. The experimental outcomes demonstrated that by adding MWCNTs to WCME fuel, the cylinder peak pressure, peak pressure rise rate, and heat release rate were slightly reduced in comparison with pure WCME fuel. The innovated fuel blend significantly decreased NOx, CO, and UHC. Additionally, the brake thermal efficiency was amended remarkably, and the specific fuel consumption was reduced compared with pure WCME fuel. According to the comparisons of engine performance and emissions, the recommended dose level of MWCNTs with WCME fuel was concluded to be 50 mg/l, which gave a substantial improvement in all engine performance characteristics (where NOx was reduced by 40%, CO by 40%, UHC by 50% and bsfc by 18%). © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - CI engine is an important and widely used engine in the power generation industries generally fuelled by diesel. The use of CI engine vehicles is increasing continuously day by day which in turns diesel fuel consumption and engine emissions increases. Limitation of these conventional fuel as well as continuously increasing global warming by engine emissions has motivated to researchers in the field of alternative renewable fuel source like biofuel such as biodiesel, methanol, ethanol etc. Ethanol is the most commonly researched alcoholic fuel as alternative fuel. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of ethanol-diesel fuel blend on engine performance such as BSFC, BTE, brake power, brake torque as well as engine emission parameters such as NOx, CO, HC, exhaust gas temperature etc. of a CI engine. Through this study it was found that ethanol significantly reduces HC, PM, NOx and exhaust gas temperature but slightly increases fuel consumption. Also, ethanol additive enhanced engine performance like BTE, brake power and brake torque. The outcomes of this study may help for researchers to understand the effect of ethanol addition on engine performances and emissions at different ethanol-diesel fuel blend concentration for CI engine. © 2019 Lavoisier.

AB  - Bio-oil obtained from thermal cracking of waste cooking oil (WCO) is a complex mixture of different chemical compounds and, like crude oil, it is composed mainly of hydrocarbons. The large number of compounds in bio-oil leads to complex and expensive methods for its properties determination. In this study, the distillation curves were constructed for samples of bio-oils obtained from the thermal cracking of WCO in order to predict the properties (such as molecular weight, viscosity and refractive index). Although it is not often employed for bio-oil analyses, the distillation curve method is commonly used in the petroleum industry. Atmospheric and vacuum distillations were performed according to ASTM D86 and ASTM D1160 standards, respectively, for six samples of bio-oil and one sample of crude oil. The results were converted to true boiling point (ASTM D2892) according to the API method (1997) and common petroleum refning correlations were employed. The estimated values for the properties showed little deviation in relation to the experimental data. The bio-oil and crude oil samples contained heavy compounds in their composition, and all samples studied are considered as heavy oils considering the °API range. © 2019 Assoc. Brasiliera de Eng.

AB  - Oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) are the main pollutants from diesel engines. Bio-diesel fuel, as alternative fuel, has potential to reduce the formation of NOx and PM. And emulsion fuel is a mixture of fuel and water that can reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) and PM in exhaust gas when it is burned in a diesel or other heat engines. Reduction of NOx is originated from the reduction of local high temperature due to vaporized water during combustion. The aim of the present study is performed on the production of the stable bio-diesel emulsion fuel. In this research, a bubble pulse caused by an underwater explosion is used to emulsify samples, i.e., water (in the range of 5–20%) and bio-diesel fuel with two different specific surfactants. This mechanism of the emulsification is observed by a high speed video camera. It is found that (i) the process of generating emulsification under the underwater explosion is disclosed, (ii) the stable emulsion fuel is affected by HLB, i.e., the ratio of two different specific surfactants and the timewise stability of the emulsion fuel is attributed to the scattering intensity of the measured water particle size. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Environmental impacts of fossil fuels and their limited supply are driving the development and use of bio-diesel. Globally, bio-diesel is gaining importance because of its environmental advantages. Jatropha curcas has been widely considered as a potential feedstock for the production of bio-diesel in several tropical countries. This study employs a method of data collection that is a face-to-face interview, along with a questionnaire. The questionnaire is designed, taking into consideration, different aspects of sustainable development. The survey is conducted in Kolkata, based on bio-diesel producing companies. Statistical analysis using SPSS version 17 is used for analysing the data collected from different bio-diesel producing companies from respondents of sample size 100 based on the questionnaire. Analysis of primary data collected is evaluated by chi-square and correlation tests. The results indicate that the relationship of design, maintenance, process capability, facility management, transportation, quality, technology, material, and human resource with sustainable development, is statistically significant and positively correlated. The major barriers that industries are facing relate to inadequate quality management, missing engine approvals and high raw material cost. Removal of tax hurdles and supportive legislative measures are the most efficient measures for overcoming these barriers. Copyright © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Studies on marine-sourced fatty acids have gathered significant interest recently as an important component of aquaculture feeds and of biofuel production. Of the organisms capable of producing fatty acids, marine oomycetes are promising model organisms. One group of marine oomycetes are the Halophytophthora spp. which is known to have an important role in leaf decomposition, thereby changing the plant debris into exudates which are usable to consumers in the mangrove ecosystems. This study reports the three mangrove oomycetes isolated from Philippine mangrove forests, identified herein as Halophytophthora vesicula AK1YB2 (Aklan), H. vesicula PQ1YB3 (Quezon) and Salispina spinosa ST1YB3 (Davao del Norte). These isolates were subjected to growth analyses using varying incubation parameters (salinity level and pH), and for fatty acid production. Results revealed the presence of different fatty acids such as Arachidonic acid, Linoleic acid and Vaccenic acid when grown on V8S and PYGS media. This study is the first observation of fatty acids from S. spinosa and H. vesicula from the Philippines. Significance and Impact of the Study: Tropical Philippines straddling west of the Pacific Ocean and East of South China Sea is rich in marine and estuarine oomycetes. These micro-organisms, hitherto poorly known and unstudied in the country, play an important role in the nutritive cycle of the mangrove ecosystem. Due to the increasing demand for an alternative source of fatty acids, species of Oomycetes isolated from select mangrove forests in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao were analysed for their fatty acid contents. Prospects for industrially-important fatty acids make these Oomycetes all-important to study in applied microbiology in the Philippine setting where these structurally simple micro-organisms abound. © 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology

AB  - Solving the problems of increasing requirements on transport, while respecting actual environment criteria, new solutions are being looked for to make an optimum mutual equilibrium. One of the possibilities of increasing ecological conditions, which are decreased by means of transporting a mine, shows this contribution that suggests a reconstruction of the original diesel-hydraulic engine DH30 to two-system drive and hybrid drive. In the reconstruction, a DC and an asynchronous engine are suggested as traction engines. This reconstruction of the drive means not only increase of the ecological conditions in the mine but also an ability to use biofuel made from a crop that grew on contaminated soil. The aim of the reconstruction is to replace the combustion engine and hydraulic distribution with an electric drive while traction characteristics will remain at their values. A one-engine traction drive with an asynchronous engine with short circuit armature is regarded as one of the most prospective for an output range from several W up to MW. By using the asynchronous engine powered from semiconductive changer the problem of pulsing parts of torque is dealt with regulation. This reconstruction also means energy saving. This system also improves storing and manipulation with oil production in the mine. © 2019, Technical University of Kosice. All rights reserved.

AB  - Safflower is an olive culture of the sunflower family, the most widespread in the environment of arid regions of Central Asia. Its seeds contain 25-37% (in the core 46-60%) of semi-drying oils and up to 12% protein. As an object of study used safflower seeds of varieties Iyrkas. Aim of the present study was to determine the fatty acid composition of safflower oil received by cold pressing method. In order to do this, an SP-2560 column and a “Chromoteck 5000.1” gas chromatograph were used. When analyzing the chromatograms obtained in the study, the most crucial and complex stage is the identification of peaks. To determine the content of each fatty acid, the area normalization method was used. In the process of producing safflower oil in a cold way, waste such as cake is formed. In the study of the amino acid composition of safflower cake using ion-exchange chromatography with postcolumn derivatization of ninhydrid (without tryptophan), a Shimadzu LC-20 Prominence liquid chromatograph was used, and the determination of tryptophan by ion-exchange derivatization of ninhydrin. It is revealed that the protein of the safflower oil cake contains 18 amino acids. All amino acids that make up the safflower cake are α-amino acids. Mass fraction of essential amino acids in safflower oil was 5.66%, in particular, lysine contains 82.15 nmol/ml, methionine 45.10 nmol/ml. The obtained values for the quality characteristics indicate the prospects of using this type of natural oil: Directly for food, as well as for production of oilseeds, such as mayonnaise, sauces, spreads; as biofuel; when designing and optimizing compound feed formulations. © 2019 Mateyev et al.

AB  - Palm biodiesel is a currently used biofuel, principally as an additive or substitute of diesel fuel in vehicular internal combustion engines. In the present work, vanadium carbide (VC) coatings were deposited on gray cast iron (GCI) using the thermoreactive diffusion process (TRD) to evaluate the corrosiveness of palm biodiesel and compare it with gray cast iron corrosion behavior. VC coated and uncoated gray cast iron samples were tested by immersion corrosion tests (291 K and 313 K), cyclic oxidation test (CO), and the electrochemical impedance spectrometry test (EIS). The corrosion test showed the reduction of the corrosion rate for the VC coating when compared to gray cast iron. EIS tests of coated samples showed higher values of polarization resistance when compared with uncoated gray cast iron samples. Results confirmed that while biodiesel was more corrosive than diesel on both coated and uncoated gray cast iron, the VC coating was efficient in protecting the substrate exposed to both fuels. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The present investigation is mainly focused on the reduction of NOX emissions from the diesel engine. In this experimental work, the diesel engine has initially run by diesel alone, secondly, 10% cottonseed methyl ester biodiesel (B10) and finally emulsion of 10% water with B10 (WiB10E) in combination. The emulsified biodiesel WiB10E shows the maximum reduction of NOX emissions in comparison with the pure diesel and B10 fuel operations. Also, due to the cooling effect provided by the water in the combustion chamber, the WiB10E shows the slight increase of the HC and CO emissions. Since WiB10E fuel has a boiling point difference, it leads to secondary atomisation. The WiB10E has shown the higher cylinder pressure of 65.92 bars at a crank angle of 366° due to microexplosion. Hence, emulsified biodiesel fuel is efficient in the reduction of NOX emissions amongst all the techniques. Copyright © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - There was a heightened global interest in large-scale Jatropha cultivation for the past few decades, and this incited investment toward the crop in many developing countries. Many saw Jatropha as a green fuel that could possibly be an alternative to fossil fuel, which has adverse implications to deal with the impacts of climate change. However, Jatropha investments failed to meet global expectations, leading to unexpected social, environmental, and economic transformations in the investment spaces. This paper reviews and synthesizes the transformations and complexities in failed Jatropha spaces in six previous major Jatropha investment destinations across the world-Mexico, India, China, Ethiopia, Mozambique, and Ghana-by employing qualitative data analysis. The findings generally show that, in all of the countries studied, promoters of Jatropha investments, including the central government and private investors, subscribed to a "wait-and-see" approach with positive expectations. The review revealed that the intended goal of establishing global Jatropha investments to serve as an alternative source of fuel failed because of the unexpected complexities of the hype, which dwelled much on the deferment option of the "wait-and-see" approach for global Jatropha investments. Failure of the investments along with unmet expectations led to land-use changes from Jatropha to the cultivation of other crops (often food crops) or total land abandonment. Although we are not totally pessimistic about the economic and production viability of Jatropha as a biofuel feedstock, we emphasize the importance of paying considerable attention to other feedstocks that might have a better future as alternatives to fossil-based energy for the deployment of sustainable bioenergy. Furthermore, our findings provide meaningful justification for policy- and decision-makers in the development space to tacitly reflect and appraise new investment initiatives or interventions before endorsement. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - In this study, various national strategies and programs are described by planning instruments. The TIEB (Thailand Integrated Energy Blueprint), which includes six programs (AEDP, PDP, EEDP, ODP, GDP, REDP), aims to regulate renewable energy and improve the use of biofuel. In addition, the potential of second-generation biofuels is estimated with different residue extractions of second-generation biomasses: 20% (scenario 1), 44% (scenario 2), and 66% (scenario 3). Based on the production potentials that were estimated, CO2 will decrease 1.3-3.5 megatons in the gasoline sector, and 1.4-3.8 megatons in the diesel sector under scenario 1. In scenario 2, we estimated decreases of 2.8-7.7 mega tons and 3.2-8.4 mega tons of CO2 for the gasoline and diesel sectors, respectively. Finally, scenario 3 is expected to reduce the CO2 concentration by 4.2-11.6 megatons in the gasoline sector, and by 4.7-12.6 megatons in the diesel sector. We also estimate the economic potential of a second-generation biofuel with the view of emissions trading. For bioethanol and biodiesel, respectively, 27-74 million USD and 30-81 million USD could be realized in scenario 1, 60-163 million USD and 67-178 million USD in scenario 2, and 90-244 million USD and 100-267 million USD in scenario 3. We conclude that the future potential of second-generation biofuels in Thailand is optimistic, and that they can provide both environmental and economic benefits to the country. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - In this modern world, the technology is developing day by day and hence, the demand on fossil fuels and power keeps on increasing. Since the demand is very high, it is impossible to power up the entire world using petrol and diesel. The depletion of fossil fuels and the worst impact on environmental pollution have led to the search for renewable clean energies. Micro algae are presently the favourable source of biofuels for the substitution of fossil fuels. This study focused on to extract bio-oil from the Botryococcus algae which has high lipid content, by using pyrolysis method. The Botryococcus algae oil is used as the biofuel in the direct injection (DI) diesel engine. The 90% diesel is blended with 10% Botryococcus algae oil and the test was carried out to analyse the effect of diesel-biofuel on the engine performance, emission and properties such as SFC, BTE, CO, NOx and HC. The experiment was conducted on a single cylinder four stroke diesel engine with diesel and biofuel blend at varying loads. The performance and emission results of the blended biofuel and diesel were compared, and the performance results, shows the biofuel blend is almost closer to the diesel, and the biofuel blend gives less emission than the diesel.

AB  - This paper presents the correlation that represents the relation between the variation of viscosity (η) of pure and binary chemical systems of 1-alcohols and n-alkanes with temperature and pressure, number of carbon atoms and variable concentrations. Representative gasoline hydrocarbons: iso-octane, cyclohexane, 1-hexene and pseudocumene, and alcohols: 1-butanol and 2- butanol, were used in this study. Binary mixtures were: 1-hexene + 1-butanol, cyclohexane + 1-butanol, iso-octane + 1-butanol, iso-octane + 2-butanol, pseudocumene + 1-butanol, and pseudocumene + 2-butanol. Experimental data of viscosity η were correlated with Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann equation (VFT), combined with Tait�s equation. Prediction was performed using the Dymond-Assael rigid spheres model (RHS), with a modification to the model and with Eyring Theory supported by mixing laws. © 2019, Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana Iztapalapa.

AB  - The article explores the interplay between policy, technological innovation and market dynamics. It highlights the challenges of combining biofuel policies for ‘greening’ transport with reviving the Nordic forestry industry. We find that strong policy initiatives have triggered a transition to biofuel in the three Nordic countries but have so far given little stimulus to forest-industrial revival. Instead, biofuel has created dynamic change in the petroleum sector, where retailers and refineries have adopted cheap imported biofuel to diversify out of an exclusive reliance on petroleum, leaving forest-based biofuel unable to compete. However, this does not mean that the forestry industry has remained stagnant. We find that parts of the Nordic forestry industry have staged an impressive revival, though one based predominantly on high value products, such as hygiene products and labels, and not on biofuel. We conclude that, while public policy may influence commercial conditions, it does not—in a market economy—dictate the industrial strategy, which is hard to predict, especially when it moves beyond existing sector-boundaries. However, the recent adjustment in biofuel policy, in part a response to ecological critique, may represent a more promising opportunity for forest-industrial participation in the future. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Aim of this paper is to examine the bio-fuels and its assembling. Bio-fuel is any fluid fuel, which is preoccupied or got from bio-materials like trees, grass, crops, farming waste materials. Bio-powers can be delivered from any carbon source that can be re-established for a specific timeframe. Bio-powers are utilized all-inclusive in enterprises and in different spots. It is essential for the world to deliver this vitality in light of the fact that, there is an unfriendly impact on our condition by the use of traditional petro compound energizes. The examination reveals us in brief about bio-fuels and bio-mass, and the strategies for creation of Bio-fuels. The paper discusses the practicalities of creating the biofuels. There are a few advancements from which, we can infer bio-fuels which won't hurt nature, it the inexhaustible wellspring of vitality. Bio-fuels are extremely valuable wellspring of vitality and can be utilized in different fields. These energizes are broadly used to run the vehicle motor, as ethanol is utilized as added substance in gas to build its octane esteem, and to enhance its emanation and biodiesel is utilized in diesel. There are a few strategies made by the administration about the creation of bio-fuels on a huge scale. Government has wanted to build the generation of biofuels about 10%-20% continuously 2030. © TJPRC Pvt. Ltd.

AB  - Blazing of fossil energy resources generally changes the global climate. Speeding up of global temperate nowadays is an important aspect. Emission of greenhouse gases mainly from blazing of fossil energy resources is one of the most important sources. So, to carry the significant energy and to reduce air pollution, biofuels might be a substitute energy sources. The unnecessary utilization of fossil energy resources or fuels results deficient in the storage in underground earth then people naturally have to depend on biofuels. Consequently increasing demand for the manufacture of biofuels will put a huge burden on agriculture and food prices. Biofuels generally attributed as liquid fuels which are made from the biomass. This consists of mostly wood, vegetable oils, forestry products, agricultural crops, agricultural residues or municipal garbage, residues of domestic animal wastes and aquatic plants. In this review, we summarized the different types of biofuels including biodiesel and their comparative study, production and uses from an ecological perspective. © 2019 Chemical Publishing Co..

AB  - Blending diesel with biofuels, such as ethanol and palm oil methyl ester (PME), enhances the fuel properties and produces improved engine performance and low emissions. However, the presence of ethanol, which has a small cetane number and low heating value, reduces the fuel ignitability. This work aimed to study the effect of injection strategies, compression ratio (CR), and air intake temperature (Ti) modification on blend ignitability, combustion characteristics, and emissions. Moreover, the best composition of diesel–ethanol–PME blends and engine modification was selected. A simulation was also conducted using Converge CFD software based on a single-cylinder direct injection compression ignition Yanmar TF90 engine parameter. Diesel–ethanol–PME blends that consist of 10% ethanol with 40% PME (D50E10B40), D50E25B25, and D50E40B10 were selected and conducted on different injection strategies, compression ratios, and intake temperatures. The results show that shortening the injection duration and increasing the injected mass has no significant effect on ignition. Meanwhile, advancing the injection timing improves the ignitability but with weak ignition energy. Therefore, increasing the compression ratio and ambient temperature helps ignite the non-combustible blends due to the high temperature and pressure. This modification allowed the mixture to ignite with a minimum CR of 20 and Ti of 350 K. Thus, blending high ethanol contents in a diesel engine can be applied by advancing the injection, increasing the CR, and increasing the ambient temperature. From the emission comparison, the most suitable mixtures that can be operated in the engine without modification is D50E25B25, and the most appropriate modification on the engine is by increasing the ambient temperature at 350 K. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The effect of biofuel blends on the engine performance and emissions of agricultural machines can be extremely complex to predict even if the properties and the effects of the pure substances in the blends can be sourced from the literature. Indeed, on the one hand, internal combustion engines (ICEs) have a high intrinsic operational complexity; on the other hand, biofuels show antithetic effects on engine performance and present positive or negative interactions that are difficult to determine a priori. This study applies the Response Surface Methodology (RSM), a numerical method typically applied in other disciplines (e.g., industrial engineering) and for other purposes (e.g., set-up of production machines), to analyse a large set of experimental data regarding the mechanical and environmental performances of an ICE used to power a farm tractor. The aim is twofold: i) to demonstrate the effectiveness of RSM in quantitatively assessing the effects of biofuels on a complex system like an ICE; ii) to supply easy-to-use correlations for the users to predict the effect of biofuel blends on performance and emissions of tractor engines. The methodology showed good prediction capabilities and yielded interesting outcomes. The effects of biofuel blends and physical fuel parameters were adopted to study the engine performance. Among all possible parameters depending on the fuel mixture, the viscosity of a fuel blend demonstrated a high statistical significance on some system responses directly related to the engine mechanical performances. This parameter can constitute an interesting indirect estimator of the mechanical performances of an engine fuelled with such blend, while it showed poor accuracy in predicting the emissions of the ICE (NOx, CO concentration and opacity of the exhaust gases) due to a higher influence of the chemical composition of the fuel blend on these parameters; rather, the blend composition showed a much higher accuracy in the assessment of the mechanical performance of the ICE. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - This article describes an analytical procedure for the determination of copper in fuel samples using the modified graphite electrode basal pyrolysis (BPPGME) by tetrazolium salts: 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium (MTT) Br]. The determination of metals in fuel is an issue of environmental relevance because it believes that these elements can be released into the atmosphere causing damage to the environment and health. Fuel samples (ethanol, biodiesel and gasoline) were previously digested in a microwave oven using nitric acid and peroxides (biodiesel) and only nitric acid (alcohol and gasoline). The metal ion studied reacted on the surface of the chemically modified electrode to produce marked changes in the corresponding voltammograms. In order to determine the species of interest the best results were at pH 5.0 for copper and pH 6.0 for other species. The concentration scale for copper was 2.0x10-6 at 1.25 X 10-5 mol L-1. The limit of detection in fuels of samples (ethanol, biodiesel or gasoline), by ARV was 2.5x10-6 mol L-1. The accuracy of the proposed technique was compared by providing similar results, ie the copper concentration in the samples analyzed by both techniques at a non-statistically different 95% certainty level. © 2019 Tche Quimica Group.

AB  - Emissions of greenhouse gases are still a burning social problem and the objectives aimed at reducing the environmental burden are in line with the “binding targets” set by the EU for this sphere. The largest contributor to such emissions is transport industry. One of the ways of reducing emissions in transportation is the use of non-fossil, preferably renewable, fuels (biofuels). However, this is linked with many economic issues. The objective of this paper is to verify the efficiency of investments in biofuel production using various models. Its authors have analysed factors influencing the calculation of return on investment including impacts on the discount factor for calculation of the net present value (NPV) of such investments. Not only the NPV evaluation was performed but also the sensitivity analysis. Three models have been defined for this purpose.. The purpose of model calculations was not to define precisely the attractiveness of various fuels, but rather to point out risks of higher investments in expensive technologies and productions where raw material resources are not ensured. © 2019 Czech Environment Management Center.

AB  - Biodiesel is a renewable plant-based fuel as an alternative for fossil diesel fuel which has many advantages. However, its high content of unsaturated fatty acid causes an oxidation instability during storage. Numerous additives have been used and developed to overcome this problem such as the application of phenolic compound-based antioxidants. Pyrogallol is reported to be one of the best phenolic antioxidants for biodiesel. Unfortunately, pyrogallol has a low solubility in oil solution. In this research, pyrogallol solubility is increased by preparing a pyrogallol derivative through a reaction between pyrogallol and methyl linoleate in the presence of radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). The spectrophotometric method was used for solubility test. Antioxidant potential was examined using acid value determination during a four-week storage period as well as the Rancimat test to see its performance under accelerated oxidation conditions. The reaction produced a molecule which has a molecular weight of 418 g/mol, representing pyrogallol derivative which has a new C-O covalent bond with methyl linoleate. The result was confirmed by using nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, and 2D-HMQC) resulting in a molecular structure of methyl (10E,12E)-9-(2,6-dihydroxyphenoxy)octadeca-10,12-dienoate and its isomer methyl (9E,11E)-13-(2,6-dihydroxyphenoxy)octadeca-9,11-dienoate with a yield of 12.86% and selectivity of 21.05% on the basis of pyrogallol. Compared to pyrogallol, tertbutylhydroquinone (TBHQ), and gallic acid, the pyrogallol derivative has the highest solubility and acid value stability in palm oil biodiesel. The Rancimat induction time (IP) result of the pyrogallol derivative is higher than the biodiesel and is above the accelerated oxidation test American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D 6751 standard. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - This article studies the combustion of refined sunflower, virgin sunflower and virgin rapeseed oils in a low-pressure auxiliary air fluid pulverization burner in order to establish the optimal operating conditions. The influence of varying the type of vegetable oil, fuel flow rate and secondary airflow rate in the combustion process was analyzed. These three factors are independent in the combustion process, which means having to carry out numerous assays, combining the various factors with one another. Given the amount of variables to be optimized and the existence of three factors, a statistical approach is adopted to help interpret the results obtained and to evaluate how each factor influences the combustion results. Optimal combustion is determined based on three criteria, minimum pollutant emissions (CO, NOx and CxHy), maximum combustion performance, and minimum excess air. The result of this study showed that airflow was the principal factor affecting emissions, whereas for combustion performance, both factors (airflow and fuel flow) were determinant. In general, admissible combustion performances were obtained, with CO and NOx emissions below permitted levels. The best combustion performance was achieved under conditions of maximum fuel flow and minimum airflow rates. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Biofuels, namely, biodiesel and ethanol produced from renewable energy sources are used as fuels in the blended form along with diesel to investigate the performance and emission characteristics of a DI diesel engine. Diestrol blend consists of diesel, biodiesel/methyl ester and ethanol. In diestrol blends, ethanol percentage is steadily elevated with an incremental factor of 5% culminating into three blends with a maximum percentage of 15% by volume and named as EB5, EB10 and EB15 respectively. A comprehensive analysis of engine performance characteristics such as brake thermal efficiency, brake specific fuel consumption, exhaust gas temperature and emission characteristics such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, unburned hydrocarbon, oxides of nitrogen and smoke opacity were carried out. From the above investigation, it was found that brake thermal efficiency increased by 3%, 5% and oxides of nitrogen emission decreased by 23%, 24.5% when compared to diesel and B20 respectively.

AB  - The commercial production of advanced fuels based on bio-oil gasification could be promising because the cost-effective transport of bio-oil could promote large-scale implementation of this biomass technology. So far there has been no specialized review of bio-oil gasification processes, including non-catalytic partial oxidation of bio-oil for syngas production and steam gasification of bio-oil for hydrogen production. A detailed and comprehensive review of gasification of bio-oil for gas production is presented in this paper. The background and significance of bio-oil research, the characteristics of bio-oil suitable for gasification, bio-oil gasification theory, types and configurations of bio-oil gasifiers, the quality of the product gas, parameter effects, and economic evaluation of bio-oil gasification are discussed, and finally a summary and future outlook are also delivered. Particular emphasis is placed on the discussion regarding the atomization of bio-oil, entrained flow gasifiers and their advantages, gas composition and the economic feasibility of production of advanced fuels via bio-oil gasification. Challenges for the future are identified as follows: (1) making full use of the experience accumulated in the area of petroleum refining; (2) practical demonstration of bio-oil gasification on a scale of 500 to 1000 kg bio-oil per hour; (3) the development of mathematical models for bio-oil gasification systems; and (4) development of suitable catalysts and profoundly understanding the catalyst deactivation mechanism at different stages for steam gasification of bio-oil. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - CI engine have always been the primary choice for on-road, agriculture and industrial applications. On-road operations are dominated by CI engines because of their better efficiency, fuel availability and fuel economy. Worldwide, nearly 14% of greenhouse gas emissions are releasing from the world’s highest energy demanding sector, transportation. The day-by-day increase in diesel engine’s use associated with the aspiration of underdeveloped or developing countries to improve their economic status has led to increase the demand for diesel fuel supply, which is causing running out of fossil fuel very shortly. The increasing fuel usage will increase the level of air pollutants in the atmosphere, which are threatening the environment and human health. Fossil fuel depletion and harmful exhaust gas emissions has created an intensive interest for the development of renewable alternative fuel. Since last three decades, researchers are showing interest to develop an alternative fuel from biomass-based feed stock. Fuels developed from biomass-based feed stock are referred as biofuels. These biofuels can be categorized into bio-alcohols and biodiesel, which are more suitable to use as an alternate fuel for SI and CI engines because of their high octane and cetane numbers respectively. This paper presents the exhaustive review of literature on testing of different renewable alternative biofuels under different testing conditions in CI engine to replace petroleum diesel and to have effective control over the harmful exhaust emissions. This paper also gives insight of recent trends in development of fourth generation biofuels based on photobiological solar fuels and electro fuels, which can be a more promising alternate fuel in the field of biofuels. © 2019, Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication.

AB  - A renewable clean energy is sine qua non for mitigation of toxic and greenhouse gas emissions, preservation of natural ecosystem, biodiversity and its sustainability. Hence, this research work focuses on the evaluation of biofuel potential characteristics of Salicornia plant’s oil (halophytes) that grows in arid and salt water environment devoid of suitable edaphic and ecological factors that could support the growth and development of normal vegetable plants. Two species of the Salicornia plants were investigated. These are Salicornia bigelovii and Salicornia brachiata. A supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) process using carbon dioxide (CO2) modified with ethanol as extraction solvent yielded 32.14% of S. bigelovii oil and an oil yield of 26.58% S. brachiata. The fatty acid compositional analysis was determined by Agilent, HP6890 gas chromatograph with flame ionization detector (GC-FID). A 30% concentration of Candida antarctica lipase catalyst that was immobilized on a macro-porous, acrylic resin particles was used for the transesterification process. While biodiesel yield of 92.80% and 81.30% were obtained with t-butanol solvent, a yield of 59.34% and 48.76% was obtained in solvent-free system for S. bigelovii and S. brachiata, respectively. Finally, S. bigelovii biodiesel exhibited better cold flow properties but with very poor fuel critical characteristics, such as low cetane number, high iodine value and low heating value, which when applied in diesel engine could result in abnormal combustion, performance and emission behaviour. Whereas, S. brachiata showed a superlatively promising biodiesel fuel characteristics that is typical of those recommended by American and European biodiesel standards, and thus a technically viable diesel alternative in compression-ignition engines. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - The present study investigates the suitability of growing Dicloster acuatus MH013435 and Kalenjinia gelatinosa MH012185 in Garcinia cambogia washwater for biomass production and nutrient removal. In recent years, the wastewater effluent treatment with microalgae is gaining importance since it serves multiple purposes including CO2 sequestration, production of biofuel feedstock and value-added biochemicals in addition to wastewater treatment. Contaminated washwater is generated at a significant quantity during extraction of hydroxycitric acid from G. cambogia and it represents a serious environmental concern when discharged without proper processing. However, this G. cambogia washwater can be used as a low-cost source of nutrients for microalgal growth. The two microalgal species D. acuatus MH013435 and K. gelatinosa MH012185 demonstrated robust growth in washwater and achieved maximum biomass concentration of 0.68 and 0.63 g/L dry weight. The nitrate was removed to an extent of 98.5 and 99.6% whereas chloride removal was 72 and 80.5%, sulfate concentration got reduced by 98 and 98.7% and phosphate got reduced to 95 and 92% for D. acuatus MH013435 and K. gelatinosa MH012185, respectively. The results indicate the suitability of D. acuatus MH013435 and K. gelatinosa MH012185 in treating G. cambogia washwater with efficient nutrient removal. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Green technologies have emerged as useful tools for the generation of clean fuels with the potential to minimize the effect of human activity on the environment. Currently, these fuels are mainly composed of hydrocarbons obtained from crude oil. Over the past two decades, biomass has gained significant attention as a renewable feedstock for more sustainable biofuel production and has been a great candidate to replace fossil fuels. The principal components of most of the available biomass are cellulose, hemi-cellulose, and lignin. Although the available green technologies for biofuel production are progressing rapidly, productivity and chemical yield from these techniques are still below the required values. Therefore, there is a need for interdisciplinary studies to meet the requirements for more global and efficient production by streamlining processes, integrating technologies and achieving techno-economic improvements. In this context, we aim to give an overview of available biomass such as agricultural wastes suitable for the generation of different classes of biofuels including next-generation biofuels. Unfortunately, expensive, wasteful and energy-consuming pretreatment processes are still used. Therefore, novel technologies that allow a more efficient separation with low resource consumption and the generation of a low number of residues are required. In this regard, novel technologies such as efficient fractionation techniques and genetic and metabolic engineering including the application of CRISPR/Cas tools, as well as microfluidic platforms to improve the overall yield of biofuel production are discussed. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Biocrudes derived from hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) and lipid extraction (EXT) of the high-lipid Scenedesmus were hydrotreated to investigate the influences of the feedstock on the profiles of the hydrotreating biofuels. For HTL and EXT biocrudes, similar yields were obtained (52.87% and 49.06%, wt%) but with different fatty acid (60.53% and 66.92%), C (60.28% and 74.40%), H (9.55% and 10.96%), O (26.99% and 13.81%) and N (3.19% and 0.85%) contents (wt%), HHVs (29.19 and 38.33 MJ kg-1) and chemical constituents (fatty acids and triglycerides), respectively. After hydrotreatment, 0.45 g HTL and 0.42 g EXT biofuels were obtained from 1 g Scenedesmus, with different heteroatoms (9.14% and 1.01%) and HHVs (42.77 and 48.85 MJ kg-1), respectively. However, a certain number of heavy products, such as C30+ hydrocarbons and C31+ esters, were found in both biofuels. By adjusting the reaction conditions, including the temperature and catalyst loading, the content of heavy products decreased from a maximum of 26.24% to a minimum of 1.30% at 350 °C with a 50% catalyst loading. Based on the hydrotreating model fatty acids and esters, the proposed reaction mechanism demonstrated that the formation of heavy products could be inhibited using EXT biocrude instead of HTL biocrude as the feedstock. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The effect of biofuels on the operational parameters of the combustion engines, such as performance parameters or emission production, are monitored often. These changes are, however, based on the effect of biofuels on the course of combustion pressure inside the combustion chamber. The contribution deals with the effect of rapeseed oil-diesel fuel blends on the combustion characteristics of turbocharged compression ignition engine. The course of cylinder pressure was monitored and analysed and heat release rate was calculated. The brake specific fuel consumption, indicated and brake thermal efficiency were calculated and evaluated, in-cylinder temperature and ignition delay were also evaluated. As a test fuels a 5% and 20% concentrations of rapeseed oil in diesel fuel were selected while 100% diesel fuel was used as a reference. Turbocharged CI engine Zetor 1204 located in the tractor Zetor Forterra 8642 was used for measurement. During measurement the rotation speed of the engine was kept constant at approx. 1,950 min-1 and the load of the engine was selected at approx. 20, 60, 80 and 100%. The results showed decreased cylinder peak pressure, decreased intensity of heat release rate and earlier end of combustion in all tested loads for both tested fuel blends in comparison with diesel fuel, while the lowest peak cylinder pressure was reached using fuel with 5% rapeseed oil. Fuel with 5% rapeseed oil also showed highest indicated efficiency. Ignition delay was found shorter with both of the blended fuels in comparison with diesel fuel. © 2019, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool.

AB  - Single cell oil (SCO) is an attractive alternative source of oils, since it can be used as feedstock in biofuel production and also have been recognized as viable option in production of essential fatty acids suitable for either human nutrition or as supplementary in animal feeds. However, the usability of SCO is limited due to the high price of raw materials used in the fermentation process. This problem can be tackled by using low-cost agro-industrial residues which are applicable for SCO production. Use of these by-products as the main carbon source in fermentations not only significantly reduces the overall production costs of SCO, but also enables treatment of generated waste streams, thus reducing the negative impact on environment. Since various biodegradable agro-industrial by-products can be used in microbial fermentations, this review aims to categorize and compare applicable agricultural residues by their availability, necessary pre-fermentation treatments, SCO yields and current usability in other competing sectors. © 2019, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool.

AB  - The short time use of biofuels in compression ignition engines is being studied by many authors. However, in many cases the real long–term operation of the engine on biofuels may cause problems. The article deals with the operation parameters of the combustion engine, fuelled by n-butanol – rapeseed oil – diesel fuel blend, during 70 hours operation in total. Two brand new diesel power generators Kipor KDE 6500 with output power of 4.6 kW were used for certain testing. The first generator was operated on 100% diesel fuel and it was used as a reference and the second generator was operated on experimental fuel containing 10% n-butanol – 20% rapeseed oil – 70% diesel fuel blend. The generators were equipped with single cylinder compression ignition engine Kipor KM 186 with the rated power of 5.7 kW. For the first 10 operating hours approx. 40% load was applied. Then, the generators worked for another 60 operating hours with approx. 70% load. The harmful emissions, smoke, fuel consumption and the amount of produced particles were also measured after 10 hours run-in period and then after another 60 hours of operation. Consequently, the results were compared. Measurements were carried out at gradually increasing electric power output, approx. 14%, 28%, 42%, 56%, 68%, 82% and 95% (in results can be found in Watts). Emission analyser and opacimeter BrainBee and Engine Exhaust Particle Sizer TSI were used for the measurements. The results showed increased production of emission of the engine running on fuel blend after 70 hours of operation. On the other hand, engine which operated on standard diesel reached lower fuel consumption. After 70 hours the blended fuel tended to produce more particles in comparison with diesel fuel. © 2019, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biofuels have to be produced from biomass under sustainable conditions accomplishing appropriate characteristics and specification for their use as transportation fuels. Nowadays, renewable diesel appears as a more promising option than traditional biodiesel (methyl ester), because its properties are closer to diesel, facilitating its use in current diesel motors. Hydrotreating process for obtaining renewable diesel requires catalysts which are generally supported metals. In these catalysts, the active phase can be a reduced metal, sulphide, carbide or phosphide metallic or bimetallic; while the support can be active carbon, alumina or zeolite. The reduced metals are the simplest to prepare. They do not undergo leaching and have good selectivity. In this work, the behaviour of these catalysts in the production of renewable diesel from palm oil is evaluated. Tests in a STA (simultaneous TGA and DSC) are used to compare the catalytic activity of Pt, Pd, Rh and Ru catalysts, studying the effect on selectivity and conversion of the type and concentration of the active phase, as well as the support. The tests were carried out at 5 MPa of H2 from 20 °C to 290 °C with a temperature ramp of 10 °C/min. IR and GC-MS were also used for identifying the products obtained at the best operating conditions. High selectivity and conversion were found in the generation of hydrocarbons, mainly n-C15 alkanes up to n-C18. The appearance of fatty acids with the same number of carbons was detected.

AB  - Biodiesel is a highly effective fuel with the same efficiency such as diesel oil derivative only accompanied by moderate engine modifications. This type of biofuel can be obtained from renewable sources such as vegetable, animal or frying oils. In this context, waste frying oils transesterification was studied to obtain the maximum value of biodiesel. Transesterification reactions were carried out between 70 to 90 min using waste frying oils (WFOs), methanol, and sodium hydroxide as catalyst. In order to determine the best conditions for biodiesel production, a series of experiments were carried out, using catalyst percent and temperatures in a range of 0.16 to 1.84% and 40 to 90°C, respectively. The highest biodiesel production was obtained using catalyst percent, temperature and reaction time of 0.5%, 80°C and 90 min, respectively. By statistical experimental design was possible to determine a mathematical model to predict the best operational conditions to maximize biodiesel production. Copyright © 2019, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - In order to optimize the conditions for the biofuels production by a hydrotreatment process, three platinum catalysts supported on different zeolites were evaluated. The three zeolites used for the hydrotreatment of soybean oil were USY (CBV-780), H-β and ZSM-5, impregnated with a 1 % platinum salt solution. The functional groups of the catalysts were analyzed by infrared transmission spectroscopy, the condition of the pores by scanning electron microscopy and, it was employed X-ray diffraction to determine the crystal structure. Subsequently, these catalysts were employed to hydrotreat some soybean oil samples of 80 mL, in a 300 mL reactor, operating at 525 K, 2500 kPa, and a H2/N2 molar ratio of 30 % for 6 h. Some gas chromatography analyses carried out over the synthesized biofuels evidenced that Zeolite H-β presents the best characteristics for the production of a biofuel with most similar properties to the currently employed fossil fuels.

AB  - Using microalgae as a source of energy for producing oil and biodiesel presents many advantages respect feedstocks. The microalgae shows a high yield per cultivated area, there are several output as final biofuels products and does not compete with food production, being classified as a third generation biofuel. The influence of microalgae biomass yield under different culture conditions are in this paper analyzed. The microalgae Chlorella vulgaris culture was developed at laboratory scale using 6 elermeyers of 250 mL following the methodology described in the Watanabe medium modified. The culture conditions were 28°C ± 1°C with a pH value between 6-7. The cell count through microscopy let the speed grows determination of the studied microalgae strain for ten days reaching the maximum concentration of cells with vitamins and air supply, registering 450.5xl04 cells/mL. At five days of culture, the yield of those including vitamins was 8 times higher compared to the Start of experiments, but 7 times without vitamins. The highest yield was registered for a culture with vitamins and air supply, twenty times higher than the respective values for the first day. The obtained results demonstrated the Chlorella vulgaris microalgae potential for its use on energetic purposes, particularly for biodiesel production. © 2019 Asociacion de Quimicos del Instituto Quimico de Sarria.

AB  - Physico-chemical properties of microalgae biodiesel depend on the microalgae species and oil extraction method. Dioctyl phthalate (DOP) is a clear, colourless and viscous liquid as a plasticizer. It is used in the processing of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resin and polymers. A new potential biofuel, hydrothermally liquefied microalgae bio-oil can contain nearly 11% (by mass) of DOP. This study investigated the feasibility of using up to 20% DOP blended in 80% diesel fuel (v/v) in an existing diesel engine, and assessed the performance and exhaust emissions. Despite reasonable differences in density, viscosity, surface tension, and boiling point, blends of DOP and diesel fuel were found to be entirely miscible and no separation was observed at any stage during prolonged miscibility tests. The engine test study found a slight decrease in peak cylinder pressure, brake, and indicated mean effective pressure, indicated power, brake power, and indicated and brake thermal efficiency with DOP blended fuels, where the specific fuel consumption increased. This is due to the presence of 16.4% oxygen in neat DOP, responsible for the relatively lower heating value, compared to that of diesel. The emission tests revealed a slight increase in nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions from DOP blended fuels. However, particulate matter (PM) emissions were lower from DOP blended fuels, although some inconsistency in particle number (PN) was present among different engine loads. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Biodiesel is gaining more and more importance due to environmental issues. This way, alternative and sustainable crops as new biofuel sources are demanded. Safflower could be a sustainable raw material for biodiesel production, showing one disadvantage (as many biodiesels from vegetable oils), that is, a short oxidative stability. Consequently, the use of antioxidants to increase this parameter is mandatory. The aim of this research work was to assess the effect of two antioxidants (butylated hydroxyanisole, BHA, and tert-butylhydroquinone, TBHQ) on the oxidative stability of safflower biodiesel, which was characterized paying attention to its fatty acid methyl ester profile. For oxidative stability, the Rancimat method was used, whereas for fatty acid profile gas chromatography was selected. For the remaining parameters, the methods were followed according to the UNE-EN 14214 standard. The overall conclusion was that safflower biodiesel could comply with the standard, thanks to the use of antioxidants, with TBHQ being more effective than BHA. On the other hand, the combined use of these antioxidants did not show, especially at low concentrations, a synergic or additive effect, which makes the mixture of these antioxidants unsuitable to improve the oxidative stability. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Current policies focus on encouraging the use of renewable energy sources in transport to reduce the contribution of this sector to global warming and air pollution. In the short-term, attention is focused on developing renewable fuels. Among them, the so-called advanced biofuels, including non-crop and waste-based biofuels, possess important benefits such as higher greenhouse gas (GHG) emission savings and the capacity not to compete with food markets. Recently, European institutions have agreed on specific targets for the new Renewable Energy Directive (2018/2001), including 14% of renewable energy in rail and road transport by 2030. To achieve this, advanced biofuels will be double-counted, and their contribution must be at least 3.5% in 2030 (with a phase-in calendar from 2020). In this work, the fuel properties of blends of regular diesel fuel with four advanced biofuels derived from different sources and production processes are examined. These biofuels are (1) biobutanol produced by microbial ABE fermentation from renewable material, (2) HVO (hydrotreated vegetable oil) derived from hydrogenation of non-edible oils, (3) biodiesel from waste free fatty acids originated in the oil refining industry, and (4) a novel biofuel that combines fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) and glycerol formal esters (FAGE), which contributes to a decrease in the excess of glycerol from current biodiesel plants. Blending ratios include 5, 10, 15, and 20% (% vol.) of biofuel, covering the range expected for biofuels in future years. Pure fuels and some higher ratios are considered as well to complete and discuss the tendencies. In the case of biodiesel and FAME/FAGE blends in diesel, ratios up to 20% meet all requirements set in current fuel quality standards. Larger blending ratios are possible for HVO blends if HVO is additivated to lubricity improvers. For biobutanol blends, the recommended blending ratio is limited to 10% or lower to avoid high water content and low cetane number. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The current fossil fuel reserves are not sufficient to meet the increasing demand and very soon will become exhausted. Pollution, global warming, and inflated oil prices have led the quest for renewable energy sources. Algal biofuels represent a potential source of renewable energy. Algae, as the third generation feedstock, are suitable for biodiesel and bioethanol production due to their quick growth, excellent biomass yield, and high lipid and carbohydrate contents. With their huge potential, algae are expected to surpass the first and second generation feedstocks. Only a few thousand algal species have been investigated as possible biofuel sources, and none of them was ideal. This review summarizes the current status of algal biofuels, important steps of algal biofuel production, and the major commercial production challenges. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The effects of three kinds of oxygenated fuel blends—i.e., ethanol-gasoline, n-butanol-gasoline, and 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF)-gasoline-on fuel consumption, emissions, and acceleration performance were investigated in a passenger car with a chassis dynamometer. The engine mounted in the vehicle was a four-cylinder, four-stroke, turbocharging gasoline direct injection (GDI) engine with a displacement of 1.395 L. The test fuels include ethanol-gasoline, n-butanol-gasoline, and DMF-gasoline with four blending ratios of 20%, 50%, 75%, and 100%, and pure gasoline was also tested for comparison. The original contribution of this article is to systemically study the steady-state, transient-state, cold-start, and acceleration performance of the tested fuels under a wide range of blending ratios, especially at high blending ratios. It provides new insight and knowledge of the emission alleviation technique in terms of tailoring the biofuels in GDI turbocharged engines. The results of our works showed that operation with ethanol–gasoline, n-butanol–gasoline, and DMF–gasoline at high blending ratios could be realized in the GDI vehicle without any modification to its engine and the control system at the steady state. At steady-state operation, as compared with pure gasoline, the results indicated that blending n-butanol could reduce CO2, CO, total hydrocarbon (THC), and NOXemissions, which were also decreased by employing a higher blending ratio of n-butanol. However, a high fraction of n-butanol increased the volumetric fuel consumption, and so did the DMF–gasoline and ethanol–gasoline blends. A large fraction of DMF reduced THC emissions, but increased CO2and NOXemissions. Blending n-butanol can improve the equivalent fuel consumption. Moreover, the particle number (PN) emissions were significantly decreased when using the high blending ratios of the three kinds of oxygenated fuels. According to the results of the New European Drive Cycle (NEDC) cycle, blending 20% of n-butanol with gasoline decreased CO2emissions by 5.7% compared with pure gasoline and simultaneously reduced CO, THC, NOXemissions, while blending ethanol only reduced NOXemissions. PN and particulate matter (PM) emissions decreased significantly in all stages of the NEDC cycle with the oxygenated fuel blends; the highest reduction ratio in PN was 72.87% upon blending 20% ethanol at the NEDC cycle. The high proportion of n-butanol and DMF improved the acceleration performance of the vehicle. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The oxidation degradation characteristics of four types of bioethanol fuel and one type of biodiesel fuel were investigated. It was found that rape methyl ester (RME) was the fuel that was most susceptive to oxidative degradation, whereas bioethanol fuels were resistant. Oxidative degradation of the fuels promoted the formation of fatty acids in the water phase. Once all formic and acetic acid contained in the oxidized RME was distributed in 0.1 vol% of the water phase, its pH was estimated to be ~1.6. Of the different stainless steel variants in the corrosion tests, which simulated the most severe conditions, SUS436L and SUS444 exhibited excellent corrosion resistance. © 2019 Society of Automotive Engineers of Japan, Inc.

AB  - An emerging ultrasonic technology aims to control high-pressure industrial processes that use liquids at pressures up to 800 MPa. To control these processes it is necessary to know precisely physicochemical properties of the processed liquid (e.g., Camelina sativa oil) in the high-pressure range. In recent years, Camelina sativa oil gained a significant interest in food and biofuel industries. Unfortunately, only a very few data characterizing the high-pressure behavior of Camelina sativa oil is available. The aim of this paper is to investigate high pressure physicochemical properties of liquids on the example of Camelina sativa oil, using efficient ultrasonic techniques, i.e., speed of sound measurements supported by parallel measurements of density. It is worth noting that conventional low-pressure methods of measuring physicochemical properties of liquids fail at high pressures. The time of flight (TOF) between the two selected ultrasonic impulses was evaluated with a cross-correlation method. TOF measurements enabled for determination of the speed of sound with very high precision (of the order of picoseconds). Ultrasonic velocity and density measurements were performed for pressures 0.1-660 MPa, and temperatures 3-30XC. Isotherms of acoustic impedance Za, surface tension and thermal conductivity k were subsequently evaluated. These physicochemical parameters of Camelina sativa oil are mainly influenced by changes in the pressure p, i.e., they increase about two times when the pressure increases from atmospheric pressure (0.1 MPa) to 660 MPa at 30XC. The results obtained in this study are novel and can be applied in food, and chemical industries. © 2019 Polish Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

AB  - This work aimed to investigate algal diversity at the genus level in stabilization pond systems treating domestic wastewater and to evaluate the feasibility of an electroflotation by alternate current (EFAC) system for simultaneous microalgae separation and cell disruption. Evaluation of algal diversity showed that the genera Euglena and Chlorella were present in relatively high frequencies in five of the six effluents analyzed. The use of EFAC on an effluent that presented bloom of Chlorella achieved turbidity and chlorophyll-a removal efficiencies higher than 70 and 90%, respectively, after 70 minutes of operation. Total lipid yield for the Chlorella-rich biomass was 21.4±2.02%. Such high biomass lipid content demonstrates the potential for obtaining lipid-based biofuels from wastes. The current paper describes the first attempt, with promising results, at using electroflotation by alternate current for low cost, simultaneous microalgae harvesting and disruption. © 2019, ABES - Associacao Brasileira de Engenharia Sanitaria e Ambiental.

AB  - In this work, the antioxidant properties of methanolic extract of Larrea tridentata were assessed through the free radical scavenging method, ferric reducing antioxidant power and oxygen radical absorbance capacity. The phenolic acids content in the extract was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the total phenol content by the Folin-Ciocalteu method. The extract was used as an antioxidant in biodiesel from canola oil composed mostly by fatty acid methyl esters identified and quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometry (GC-MS). The performance of the extract as an antioxidant was assessed by the oxidative stability index (OSI) with a Rancimat equipment at 100, 110, 120 and 130 °C. Additionally, the change of the peroxide value (PV) and the higher heating value under conditions of oxidative stress at 100 °C and air injection were measured. The antioxidant capacity of the extract reached 50,000 TAEC (micromole of Trolox antioxidant equivalent capacity per gram). The biodiesel was constituted by more than 70% of unsaturated fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), mainly methyl oleate. The time needed to reach a PV of 100 meqO2/kg was almost four times longer with an antioxidant concentration of 250 mg/L than the blank. The biodiesel showed an OSI time of 1.25 h at 110 °C, while it increased to 8.8, 15.89 and 32.27 h with the antioxidant at concentrations of 250, 500 and 1000 mg/L, respectively. The methanolic Larrea tridentata extract proved to have an antioxidant capacity and it is a green antioxidant in biodiesel to increase its oxidative stability. According to the results obtained, the L. tridentata methanolic extract is an alternative to the commercial synthetic antioxidants used in biodiesel nowadays. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - In this work, production of biodiesel from blends of virgin castor oil (VCO) and waste frying oil (WFO) was studied. Initial blends and the biodiesel obtained were characterized and the properties were analyzed statistically. Results indicated that the content of WFOs of the blends influenced the physical and chemical properties of the biofuel, but did not influence the rheological behavior of the biodiesel. Physical and chemical properties of biodiesel were also predicted using molecular descriptors (MDs) using several architectures of artificial neural networks (ANNs). Optimum architecture (configuration 10-2-20-3) was found for the lowest deviations in the three dependent variables (fuel acidity, ketone index, and kinematic viscosity). © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The paper presents the effects made by a fossil diesel-HRD (Hydrotreated Renewable Diesel) fuel blend containing Ethanol (E) or Biodiesel (B) on the combustion process, Indicated Thermal Efficiency (ITE), smoke, and pollutant emissions when running a turbocharged Common Rail Direct Injection (CRDI) engine under medium (50% of full load), intermediate (80% of full load), and full (100%) loads at maximum torque speed of 2000 rpm. These loads correspond to the respective Indicated Mean Effective Pressures (IMEP) of 0.75, 1.20, and 1.50 MPa, developed for the most common operation of a Diesel engine. The fuel-oxygen mass content was identically increased within the same range of 0 (E0/B0), 0.91 (E1/B1), 1.81 (E2/B2), 2.71 (E3/B3), 3.61 (E4/B4), and 4.52 wt% (E5/B5) in both E and B fuel groups. Nevertheless, these fuels still possessed the same blended cetane number value of 55.5 to extract as many scientific facts as possible about the widely differing effects caused by ethanol or biodiesel properties on the operational parameters of an engine. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses of the effects made by the combustion of the newly designed fuels with the same fuel-oxygen mass contents of various origins on the engine operational parameters were conducted comparing data between themselves and with the respective values measured with the reference ('baseline'), oxygen-free fuel blend E0/B0 and a straight diesel to reveal the existing developing trends. The study results showed the positive influence of fuel-oxygen on the combustion process, but the fuel oxygen enrichment rate should be neither too high nor too low, but just enough to achieve complete diffusion burning and low emissions. The Maximum Heat Release Rate (HRRmax) was 3.2% (E4) or 3.6% (B3) higher and the peak in-cylinder pressure was 4.3% (E3) or 1.1% (B5) higher than the respective values the combustion of the reference fuel E0/B0 develops under full load operation. Due to the fuel-oxygen, the combustion process ended by 7.3° (E4) or 1.5° crank angle degrees (CADs) (B4) earlier in an engine cycle, the COV of IMEP decreased to as low as 1.25%, the engine efficiency (ITE) increased by 3.1% (E4) or decreased by 2.7% (B3), while NOx emissions were 21.1% (E3) or 7.3% (B4) higher for both oxygenated fuels. Smoke and CO emissions took advantage of fuel-oxygen to be 2.9 times (E4) or 32.0% (B4) lower and 4.0 (E3) or 1.8 times (B5) lower, respectively, while THC emissions were 1.5 times (E4) lower or, on the contrary, 7.7% (B4) higher than the respective values the combustion of the fuel E0/B0 produces under full load operation. It was found that the fuel composition related properties greatly affect the end of combustion, exhaust smoke, and pollutant emissions when the other key factors such as the blended cetane number and the fuel-oxygen enrichment rates are the same in both fuel groups for any engine load developed at a constant (2000 rpm) speed. © 2019 MDPI AG.

AB  - A water-in-oil emulsion droplet may undergo a phenomenon called microexplosion when under strong heating. A microexplosion can be defined as the atomization of the continuous phase (i.e., oil) by the dispersed droplets (i.e., water) phase change and the volume expansion that is induced. It is established that microexplosion occurrence is favored by the (partial) coalescence of water droplets before phase change. This process has direct influence on the time evolution of water droplet size. For this purpose, an experimental method based on laser-induced fluorescence is set up. It basically consists of adding a fluorescent dye, fluorescein, which is soluble only in water, and exciting the emulsion drop by a laser sheet during its heating. The goal is to gain a better understanding of microexplosion by measuring the size evolution of dispersed droplets and targeting the water droplet that triggers the atomization of the emulsion drop. The sizing procedure showed promising results. Manual and automatic measurements of the size were compared in order to quantify the average error, which happens to be < 10%. Results show that the size of this trigger droplet is not sufficient in order to determine whether an emulsion drop will undergo optimal atomization. © 2019 by Begell House, Inc.

AB  - An experimental investigation is performed in a single-cylinder direct-injection (DI) diesel engine using city diesel oil called DI1 and two blends of DI1 with a mixture of glycol ethers. The addition of glycol ethers to fuel DI1 produced oxygenated fuels GLY10 (10.2 mass-% glycol ethers) and GLY30 (31.3 mass-% glycol ethers) with 3% and 9% oxygen content, respectively. The addition of biofuel rapeseed methyl ester (RME) to fuel DI1 produced oxygenated blend RME30 (31.2 mass-% RME) with 3% oxygen content. Engine tests were performed with the four fuels in the DI diesel engine at 2500 RPM and at 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% of full load. The experimental diesel engine was equipped with devices for recording cylinder pressure, injection pressure, and top dead center (TDC) position and also it was equipped with exhaust gas analyzers for measuring soot, NO, CO, and HC emissions. A MATLAB 2014 code was developed for analyzing recorded cylinder pressure, injection pressure, and TDC position data for all obtained engine cycles and for calculating the main engine performance parameters. The assessment of the experimental results showed that glycol ethers have more beneficial impact on soot and NO emissions compared to RME, whereas RME have less detrimental impact on engine performance parameters compared to glycol ethers. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The aim of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of the unit gas emission value in the exhaust of a dual fuel diesel engine. The results of the effects of a diesel engine's applications in biogas plants and the method for calculating mass gas emissions per unit of produced electricity are shown. The test was performed using a two-cylinder, naturally aspirated, liquid-cooled diesel engine. The diesel engine powered a generator connected to the grid. The engine was fed with liquid fuels-waste cooking oil methyl ester (UCOME) and diesel fuel (DF)-and with a gas fuel, biogas (BG). The engine ran at a constant rotational speed (2000 rpm ± 30 rpm) with variable load. The gas analyzer measured the amount of CO, NO, NO2, and PM (particulate matter) in exhaust gas. This gas content share was then converted to mass per engine generated energy unit. This experiment showed the effect of BG introduced to the intake manifold on fuel combustion, as well as an increase in CO and NO2 emission and decrease in NO and PM. In terms of dependence of exhaust emissions on the type of liquid fuel used, the use of UCOME as opposed to diesel fuel resulted in PM reduction and increase of NO emissions. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Energy security, fluctuating petroleum prices, resource depletion issues and global climate change have driven countries to consider adding alternative and renewable energy options to their conventional energy share. The use of biofuel such as non-edible oils-based biodiesel is as an option over conventional diesel and could be important for the development of a sustainable and eco-friendly energy resource. The aim of the present study was to select the most feasible non-edible plant oil as biodiesel feedstock by using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), one of the multi-criteria decision making methods based on priority estimation model. Among various non-edible plant oils which are widely available in the South-East-Asian region, selection of the most feasible plant oil was evaluated based on seven criteria; seed oil yield, oil yield, free fatty acid (FFA) content, cold filter plugging point, oxidation stability, easiness to grow in marginal land, and availability in tropical areas. The obtained results from priority determination showed that nyamplung was the most efficient feedstock of biodiesel for the industry with the criteria weightage of 0.180. It was followed by kemiri sunan (2 nd order) having weightage of 0.164, physic nut 0.150 (3 rd order), indian beech 0.107 (4 th order), indian milkweed 0.095(5 th order), lead 0.092 (6 th order), kapok 0.076 (7 th order), cassia 0.049 (8 th order), soursop 0.043 (9 th order) and monkey pod 0.043 (10 th order). This study highlights an insight into multi-criteria decision making technique to assess the feasible plant oil for biodiesel production that could aid decision-making in the industry and policy development, particularly for the South-East-Asian region. © 2019 the Author(s).

AB  - Road transport is increasing all around the globe and biofuels have come to the forefront of public interest. According to Article 3, Directive 2009/28/EC, each member state has to ensure that an energy share from renewable sources in all forms of transportation reaches at least 10% of the final consumption of energy in transportation until 2020. The blending of biofuels is one of the methods available to member states to meet this target and it might even be expected to be a main contributor. This article analyses and compares selected biofuels, their chemical properties and their influence on engine operational parameters. The operational parameters of the diesel engine of the Skoda Roomster 1.4 TDI were measured on a chassis dynamometer according to the NEDC driving cycle, and pure diesel fuel, HVO and a blend of fuels (diesel fuel, HVO and butanol) were used for comparison. Operation on biofuels shows a slight decrease in performance parameters up to 10% and an increase in emission production (especially CO in the case of D50H30B20). Positive influences of biofuels were proven with a decrease in exhaust gas opacity and particulate matter production, up to 50% in the case of D50H30B20. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - This study examined the potential of nanocatalyst CuO-CeO2 and Fe2O3for efficient conversion of Sterculia foetida seed Oil into biodiesel. S. foetida contains 40% oil content and low free fatty acid value (0.18 mg KOH/g). The synthesized nanocatalyst was characterized using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) techniques. The maximum conversion was achieved (92% yield) using CuO-CeO2 at 0.25% catalyst loading. The optimized reaction was carried out by experimental variables included molar ratio (1:9), temperature (70°C), reaction time (3 h) and stirring rate (600 rpm) using reflux transesterification method. The XRD results showed the size of crystals with order 54.4 nm for CuO-CeO2 and 31.3 nm for Fe2O3. The SEM images of CuO-CeO2 showed spherical structure having an average particle size of 32.3 nm. SEM images of Fe2O3showed the size ranges from 46.27 to 28.76 nm having regular morphology, including spherical shape. The FT-IR analysis of this nanocatalyst also reinforced the results of this study. Gas Chromatography Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) confirmed the efficient conversion of S. foetida seed oil into biodiesel using prepared nanocatalysts. The prepared nanocatalysts are cheaper, readily available and can be used for industrial scale biofuel production assembly, making it economically feasible and more cost effective. © 2019 Akhtar, Ahmad, Shaheen, Zafar, Ullah, Asma, Sultana, Munir, Rashid, Malik, Saeed and Waseem.

AB  - This present study was aimed to investigate the hydrocracking of coconut oil using Ni-Fe/HZSM-5 catalyst in a batch reactor at three reaction temperatures (350, 375, and 400 °C). The Ni-Fe/HZSM-5 catalyst was prepared by using incipient wetness impregnation. The Ni-Fe/HZSM-5 catalyst was characterized using XRD, BET, and SEM-EDX. From XRD results, the loading of Ni and Fe did not change the crystalline structure of HZSM-5 catalyst. The surface area of HZSM-5 was 425 m 2 /g and decreased after the addition of metals (Ni and Fe) into HZSM-5 support. These changes implied that Ni and Fe particles were successfully dispersed on the HZSM-5 surface and incorporated into HZSM-5 pore. The product of hydrocarbon biofuel was analyzed using GC-MS. The GC-MS results of hydrocarbon biofuel showed the highest compounds for n-paraffin and yield for gasoil was 39.24 and 18.4% at a temperature of 400 °C, respectively. The reaction temperature affected the yield and the composition of hydrocarbon biofuel. At this reaction temperature condition, decarboxylation and decarbonylation were favored; lead to the formation of n-alkanes with an odd number of carbon atoms chain length. © 2019, Gadjah Mada University.

AB  - The use of biofuels in Brazil is encouraged so it is important to monitor changes in emissions from combustion processes, in air quality and impacts on the environment. Concentrations of phenanthrene in vapor and particulate phases were measured inside a bus station following the changes in the biodiesel/diesel mixtures (B0 to B8) along seven sampling campaigns. Impactors were used for collection of fine particulate material (PM2.5) and for vapor phase, cartridges with resin XAD-4. Phenanthrene was determined by HPLC and fluorimetric detection. Comparing B0 and B8 campaigns, it was observed that phenanthrene concentrations decreased by 93 % in MP2.5 and 42 % in the vapor phase. Despite that decrease, the emissions resulting from the use of diesel/biodiesel blends with the growing addition of biodiesel should continue to be investigated, due to the health risks associated with HPA exposure. © 2019 Secretaria Regional do Rio de Janeiro da Sociedade Brasileira de Quimica.

AB  - Black carbon (BC) is emitted to the atmosphere during biomass, biofuel, and fossil fuel combustion, and leaves the atmosphere via dry or wet deposition on land and on the ocean. On a global scale, wet deposition accounts for about 80% of the total atmospheric BC inputs to the ocean. The input of BC particles to the ocean can enrich surface waters with carbon and associated elements, and owing to high porosity and surface-active properties, BC can alter biogeochemical cycles by sorbing dissolved compounds and promoting aggregation. The rain-mediated input of BC to the ocean and its consequences on nutrient concentrations and particle dynamics were studied in Halong Bay, Vietnam, during a 24-h cycle impacted by short and heavy rainfall events. This study suggests that once introduced in the surface ocean via wet deposition, BC sorbs dissolved organic matter (DOM) and stimulates aggregation processes. The observed wet deposition events were characterized by sudden and pulsed inputs of BC particles that created a thin layer of sinking surface-active aggregates, acting as a net-like scavenger for DOM, nutrients (especially phosphate), and small particles. In addition, the wet deposition events coincided with an enrichment of nutrients in the surface microlayer, with an excess input of nitrogen relative to phosphorus leading to an increase of the molar N:P ratio from 24:1 to 37:1. In the underlying water, the molar N:P ratio also increased (i.e., from 39:1 to 64:1), and this can be attributed to the preferential scavenging of dissolved P-compounds on sinking BC-aggregates. © 2019 Mari, Guinot, Thuoc, Brune, Lefebvre, Angia Sriram, Raimbault, Dittmar and Niggemann.

AB  - The primary intention of this experiment is to abate the harmful emissions of imported petroleum fuel by approach of novel citronella emulsified fuel. The study is emphasized by evaluating the influence of alteration in IT (injection timing) and IP (injection pressure) in diesel engine when utilizing B20 emulsion fuel of 5% water, 1% surfactant, 14% citronella oil and 80% diesel. The IT and IP are speckled in the array of 21 degCA bTDC, 23 degCA bTDC and 25 degCA bTDC and 180, 200, 220 and 240 bar correspondingly. It is found that retarding the IT and increasing the IP along with emulsified fuel lead to increase in the brake thermal efficiency by 1.16% and minimal in the brake-specific fuel consumption by 4.86% at top load state when correlated with diesel. Exhaust emissions carbon monoxide, NO x and smoke were considerably reduced by 35%, 0.8% and 34% respectively, but slight increase in HC was observed by 5.26%; heat release rate and cylinder pressure had a considerable improvement. From the determination of these values, the optimum values of IT and IP are inferred as 21° bTDC and 200 bar.

AB  - The present study presented an inclusive analysis of engine exhaust emission characteristics of direct injection diesel engine fuelled with diesel and biofuel. Biofuel used in this investigation was obtained by steam distillation from pine oil. A single-cylinder, four-stroke diesel engine was used for this purpose. In this work, performance characteristics like brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) were analysed. The engine pollutants, namely nitrogen oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC), and smoke, were examined. In addition, combustion characteristics like in-cylinder pressure and heat release rate were presented. Two engine modification techniques, namely thermal barrier coating and the addition of antioxidant to biofuel, were attempted. The advantage of thermal barrier coating is to reduce heat loss from the engine and convert the accumulated heat into useful piston work. In this work, partially stabilised zirconia was used as the coating material. The usage of antioxidant-treated biofuel in a diesel engine was said to be the prominent approach for NOx emission reduction. Three different antioxidants, namely butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), tertiary-butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ), were exclusively dissolved at a concentration of 1% by volume with PO fuel. The obtained performance and emission characteristics of the uncoated engine were compared with the thermally coated engine. From the results, it was observed that the PO biofuel may be a promising alternative in the near prospect with the thermal barrier coating technique to enhance the performance, combustion and emission characteristics of diesel engine. The PO+TBHQ blend was considered as more beneficial than PO+BHT and PO+BHA on account of its performance, combustion and emission characteristics. The effectiveness of the antioxidant was shown in the order of TBHQ>BHA>BHT. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Inadequate resources, diminution in petroleum reserves, environmental pollution hazards and escalated crude oil pricing have become major points of concern for energy use. This urged the researchers to identify an alternative source of fuel energy similar to petroleum hydrocarbons to be used in internal combustion engine. In the present study, biodiesel from leaves of Eucalyptus tereticornis was used in the processed form in compression ignition engine. The steam distillation process yielded 4.8% of Eucalyptus bio-oil through a batch process. Single stage transesterification process using methanol and sodium hydroxide produced Eucalyptus biodiesel effectively at molar ratio of 8:1. The physico-chemical properties of Eucalyptus biodiesel were found to be comparable to commercial diesel and within ASTM limits. Eucalyptus biodiesel in straight and blended form at ratio of 50:50 with commercial diesel was used in a single cylinder compression ignition engine to understand its emission characteristics. Lower unburnt hydrocarbon and smoke emission was observed when D50EBD50 fuel blend was used at part and full load condition. EBD100 fuel emitted higher CO2 across all loads. Oxides of nitrogen emission were found to be relatively higher at full load condition when compared with D100 and D50EBD50 fuel blends. The emission parameters of EBD100 and D50EBD50 were found to be comparable with mineral diesel. © 2019 Technoscience Publications. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Fossil derived fuels available for application within the maritime sector have been dominated by heavy fuel oil (HFO), which is conventionally used in low speed (main) engines, and more refined fuels such as marine diesel oil (MDO), which is consumed in fast or medium speed engines. However, increasing fuel costs and regulatory pressure such as the restrictions placed on sulphur content have increased interest in the use of alternative fuels. A number of alternative fuels have been identified and may be viable for use within the maritime sector including straight vegetable oil (SVO) as an alternative to HFO in low speed engines, biodiesel to replace MDO/MGO in low to medium speed engines and bio-liquefied natural gas (bio-LNG) in gas engines using LNG. The potential sources of biomass feedstocks, conversion pathways and technologies are identified. The key parameters limiting their potential application are examined, in particular, availability, technological development, technical integration, and operational consequences. A proposed solution to overcome these limitations is recommended. The effective implementation of these strategies will enable the more widespread use of biofuels in marine applications, significantly reducing emissions from ships and improving global air quality and also protecting the ecological environment. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The combustion engine is a very widespread energy source for many machines and devices. Diesel, gasoline, LPG, CNG, as well as many biofuels such as ethanol, butanol, etc. are used as propellants at the present time. During the running of the internal combustion engine, some fuels penetrate into the crankcase and degrade the engine oil. This potentially reduces the lubricating ability of the oil and changes its degradation process. Submitted paper follows possible changes in lubricating capabilities of oil used in engines with specific fuels: n-butanol, LPG and diesel. Different type of fuel used in combination with an inappropriate operating mode might have a significant influence on the oil and consequently on the engine wear (monitored by a laser particle analyzer). This paper also deals with presence of various types of particles in the engine oil. Results demonstrate proceeding changes noticed in oil and also how was the degradation process effected. © 2019.

AB  - The scarcity of fossil fuels may lead to a depletion of coal, oil and natural gas in the near future. Alternative fuels, especially biofuels, are receiving considerable attention for their environmental benefits. Biodiesel is a renewable and clean burning fuel that is made from waste vegetable oils, animal fats, or recycled restaurant grease for use in diesel vehicles. Biodiesel produces fewer toxic pollutants and greenhouse gases than petroleum diesel. Many biofuels have been extracted and synthesized but little has been undertaken to study their effects on corrosion. The present investigation aims to evaluate the wet corrosion behavior of copper in used groundnut oil (UGNO) as a biofuel. The varieties of its blending ratios with commercial diesel (5, 10 and 20 %) were studied in accord with the mass loss method for a period of 100 h. The corrosion rate of the metal was evaluated according to mass loss and electrochemical methods. The corrosivity and conductivity of the test media were positively correlated. Wettability studies also supported the non-corrosive nature of biodiesel. © Carl Hanser Verlag, München Materials Testing

Indeed, all biomass components can be converted into platform chemicals, bioenergy and materials. However, thermochemical and conventional catalytic conversions suffer from a number of drawbacks. Enabling technologies, such as microwave (MW) technology, can reduce process times and energy consumption, leading to improvements in product quality and yields. The remarkable advantages of MW over conventional heating, which originate from its direct dielectric interaction with biomass, are documented in this comprehensive survey. Moreover, the use of alternative solvents that interact strongly with MW in biphasic systems can circumvent the need for additional upgradation and separation steps. Finally, this review discusses some of the challenges that MW irradiation faces, including the poor dielectric properties of some substrates and issues related to its large-scale application in pyrolysis, hydrothermal conversion and catalytic routes to biofuels, materials and platform chemicals. Waste biomass may well be the benchmark feedstock for the development of a circular bioeconomic approach. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Ethyl levulinate (EL), a biofuel additive for petroleum and biodiesel can also be used as a 100% fuel to replace petroleum diesel with the existing diesel engine. The major problem to make the EL process economical is the lack of a proper conversion technology to convert C 6 sugars such as glucose with higher yield of EL as well as process which can tolerate higher glucose concentration to increase productivity. The present study highlighted the catalytic synthesis of EL from glucose over synergetic combination of zeolite H-USY and Lewis acidic catalysts such as Sn-beta, TiO 2 , ZrO 2 , and SnO 2 . Because of the strong Lewis acidic nature and the subsequent enhancement in the isomerization rate from glucosides to fructosides, the synergetic combination of H-USY with SnO 2 showed higher EL yield than the combination with other Lewis acidic catalysts. So far, the highest EL yield of 81% from glucose (50 g/L) at 180 °C in 3 h was achieved over the optimal combination of 95% H-USY and 5% SnO 2 having strong/weak acidity and B/L ratios of 1.30 and 0.75, respectively. The study was further extended for establishing the proposed reaction mechanism without the formation of 5-hydroxymethyl furfural, levulinic acid, and formic acid which makes the overall process clean and green. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Jatropha biodiesel was produced from neat jatropha oil using both esterification and transesterification processes. The free fatty acid value content of neat jatropha oil was reduced to approximately 2% from 12% through esterification. Aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3 ) and cerium oxide (CeO 2 ) nanoparticles were added separately to jatropha biodiesel in doses of 100 ppm and 50 ppm. The heating value, acid number, density, flash point temperature and kinematic viscosity of the nanoadditive fuel samples were measured and compared with the corresponding properties of neat fossil diesel and neat jatropha biodiesel. Jatropha biodiesel with 100 ppm Al 2 O 3 nanoparticle (J100A100) was selected for engine testing due to its higher heating value and successful amalgamation of the Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles used. The brake thermal efficiency of J100A100 fuel was about 3% higher than for neat fossil diesel, and was quite similar to that of neat jatropha biodiesel. At full load, the brake specific energy consumption of J100A100 fuel was found to be 4% higher and 6% lower than the corresponding values obtained for neat jatropha biodiesel and neat fossil diesel fuels respectively. The NOx emission was found to be 4% lower with J100A100 fuel when compared to jatropha biodiesel. The unburnt hydrocarbon and smoke emissions were decreased significantly when J100A100 fuel was used instead of neat jatropha biodiesel or neat fossil diesel fuels. Combustion characteristics showed that in almost all loads, J100A100 fuel had a higher total heat release than the reference fuels. At full load, the J100A100 fuel produced similar peak in-cylinder pressures when compared to neat fossil diesel and neat jatropha biodiesel fuels. The study concluded that J100A100 fuel produced better combustion and emission characteristics than neat jatropha biodiesel. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The present work is dedicated to the experimental analysis on the influence of fuel-borne additives on ternary fuel blend operated in a single cylinder DI diesel engine. Alumina (Al 2 O 3 ) nanoparticles were chosen as fuel additives at dosing levels of 10, 20, and 30 ppm, respectively, and the ternary fuel (TF) is prepared by blending 70% diesel, 20% Jatropha biodiesel, and 10% ethanol. Performance characteristics like brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and brake-specific energy consumption (BSEC) and emission characteristics like HC, CO, NOx, and smoke along with combustion characteristics like cylinder pressure, HRR (heat release rate), and CHRR (cumulative heat release rate) were considered for analysis. Based on experimentation, it is observed that TF blended with 20 ppm alumina nanoadditive (TF20) resulted in higher BTE and lowered BSEC by 7.8 and 4.93% and lowered HC, CO, NOx, and smoke emissions by 5.69, 11.24, 9.39, and 6.48% in comparison with TF. Moreover, TF20 resulted in higher cylinder pressure, HRR, and CHRR of about 72.67 bar, 76.22 J/°CA, and 1171.1 J, respectively, which are higher than those of diesel and TF. Hence, it is concluded that the addition of 20 ppm alumina nanoadditive in TF can enhance the engine performance and combustion as well as lower the exhaust pollutants simultaneously. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The Brazilian legislation does not establish limits or methodology for the measurement of aldehydes in the exhaust of heavy diesel engines. No conclusive studies on aldehyde emissions by such engines have been found in the literature available. This work measured the aldehyde emissions from a P7 diesel cycle engine (EURO V), which was tested on an engine test bench according to ETC (European Transient Cycle) and ESC (European Stationary Cycle) cycles using fuels with 5, 7 and 20% v/v of biodiesel and 10 and 500 ppm of sulphur. The results showed that biodiesel participation in the mixture did not significantly affect the aldehyde emissions of the tested engine and that the emission level generated in the ETC cycle is higher than that obtained with the ESC cycle. The diesel content in the blend was weakly and negatively correlated with the pollutant emissions, and the inverse pattern was observed for biodiesel. This finding indicates that an increase in biodiesel content causes a slight increase in pollutant emissions. Regarding the sulphur content, positive correlations between the sulphur content and particulate matter, NOx, CO and total hydrocarbon emissions were observed. When comparing the test cycles, the results were significantly different, with higher values for the ETC cycle. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Density, viscosity and calorific values are important physical properties to affect the utilization of biofuel. In this work, mixtures of farnesane and a “jet fuel”, QAv-1, were used to study the variation of density and kinematic viscosity as a function of the volumetric fraction of farnesane and temperature. Experimental measurements were carried out for nineteen farnesane blends and pure farnesane and QAv-1, at four temperatures in the range of 293 - 323 K. Variation of high heating (HHV) and low heating (LHV) values were also determined for different blends of farnesane/QAv-1. Several empirical correlations were used to predict the density, the kinematic viscosity, HHV and LHV values. By using some of these empirical correlations, the estimated values of those three properties studied are in excellent agreement with the experimental data, with low absolute average prediction error. © 2019 Sociedade Brasileira de Quimica.

AB  - Camelina sativa is a cool-season oil seed crop that has been proven to produce various biofuels. The present study investigated the technical possibilities of using whole camelina biomass as a model feedstock in a biorefinery. This investigation examined the possibilities of using camelina seeds as a source of oil for biodiesel, sugars for ethanol, and meal for oneportfolio products. The camelina harvest residues (straw) can serve as the main source for green sugars. This study found that the energy input for the whole biorefinery process was 25.1 MJ/L ethanol, while the energy output was 54.3 MJ/L ethanol. The net energy ratio of 2.16 MJ/L ethanol was found to be competitive with other energy crops. The process was environmentally friendly, and it reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 40% if the produced biodiesel replaced petroleum diesel. The seed meals and glycerin were found to be a good source of revenue as high valueadded products and can provide an additional revenue of $1/kg of produced oil. © 2018, BioResources.

AB  - The conversion of HMF to DMF has received great attention due to its potential as a gasoline alternative. Electrosynthesis is a powerful green tool due to its significant advantages and provides an efficient and environmentally friendly route. In this work, the process uses water as the hydrogen source in the electro-catalytic reduction of 5-hydromethylfurfural (HMF) for the synthesis of 2,5-dimethyl-furan (DMF). The performance of a non-noble CuNi bimetallic electrode was investigated in the electro-catalytic hydrogenation of HMF. The electrodes prepared were characterized using XRD, SEM, XPS, and BET techniques. 88.0% faradaic efficiency of DMF and 91.1% conversion selectivity of DMF were achieved. The CuNi bimetallic electrode also displayed a good stability during the reduction of HMF to DMF. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - A catalyst comprising highly-efficient and magnetically-separable bimetallic ZnO and Co nanoparticles (NPs) deposited on N-doped carbon nanotubes (ZnO/Co@N-CNTs) was synthesized by the direct calcination of the bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazolate framework (Zn/Co-ZIF) for the effective hydrogenation (HD) and hydrodeoxygenation (HD) of lignin and its derived species. During the calcination of Zn/Co-ZIF, Zn was dislocated from the framework to the particle surface to form amorphous ZnO NPs and metallic Co NPs, which activated the growth of the N-CNTs. Because of the highly Lewis acidic amorphous ZnO, high HD/HDO ability of metallic Co NPs, and high wettability of the N-CNT, an almost complete conversion of vanillin into its corresponding deoxygenated species, creosol, was achieved in an aqueous medium without the production of byproducts under mild reaction conditions (150 °C, 0.7 MPa H2, a reaction time of 2 h). When kraft lignin and bio-oil derived from concentrated strong acid hydrolysis lignin were converted over ZnO/Co@N-CNTs, high degrees of deoxygenation of 74.2% and 34.4%, respectively, could be achieved at 350 °C, 5.0 MPa H2, and a reaction time of 6 h in water. A detailed chemical composition analysis of the deoxygenated bio-oil revealed that cyclohexanone and its alkyl group-substituted derivatives were the major species. To gain insight into the HD/HDO mechanisms, various types of lignin-derived monomers (syringaldehyde, acetovanillone, acetosyringone, 2-phenoxy-1-phenylethanol, cinnamaldehyde, isoeugenol) and holocellulose-derived monomers (furfural and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural), different types of catalysts, and various reaction parameters were tested. The mild reaction conditions, use of a non-noble metal catalyst, and use of water as the solvent make it possible to develop a cost-effective, easy to scale up, and environmental-benign process for biofuel and biochemical production. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - To investigate the potential of application of marine cyanobacterium for concurrent biomass production and ammonium removal, Synechococcus sp. VDW was cultured under different conditions in medium containing varying concentrations of NH 4 Cl. Response surface methodology (RSM) was then used to build a predictive model of the combined effects of independent variables (pH, inoculum size, ammonium concentration). At the optimum conditions of initial pH 7.4, inoculum size 0.17 (OD730) and ammonium concentration 10.5 mg L –1 , the maximum ammonium removal and biomass productivity were about 95% and 34 mg L –1 d –1 , respectively, after seven days of cultivation. The result of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis showed that the major fatty acids were palmitic acid (C16:0), linoleic acid (C18:2 n6 cis), palmitoleic acid (C16:1) and oleic acid (C18:1 n9 cis), which accounted for more than 80% weight of total fatty acids. Further, analysis of neutral lipid accumulation using flow cytometry revealed that the mean of the fluorescence intensity increased under optimal conditions. These results indicate that Synechococcus sp. VDW has the potential for use for concurrent water treatment and production of biomass that can be applied as biofuel feedstock. © 2019 by Japan Oil Chemists’ Society.

AB  - In this review problems related to design and performance of stable and efficient catalysts of biogas/biofuels transformation into syngas and hydrogen based on nanocrystalline oxides with fluorite, perovskite and spinel oxides and their nanocomposites promoted by nanoparticles of Pt group metals and Ni-based alloys are considered. Tailor-made design of these catalysts is based upon elucidation of the relationships between their synthesis procedure, composition, real structure/microstructure, surface properties, oxygen mobility and reactivity determined in a great extent by the metal-support interaction, which requires application of modern sophisticated structural, spectroscopic, kinetic (including in situ FTIRS and isotope transients) methods and mathematical modeling. Thin layers of these optimized catalysts supported on structured heat-conducting substrates, asymmetric supported oxygen or hydrogen separation membranes demonstrated high and stable performance in transformation of biogas and biofuels into syngas and hydrogen. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019.

AB  - A number of viable options are being explored for the production of energy to meet growing global energy demand. The research investigated the conversion of millet husk to liquid hydrocarbons. Furfural was produced from millet husk via a single-stage process that involved simultaneous hydrolysis and dehydration processes, and was subsequently converted to straight-chain hydrocarbons through aldol condensation and hydrodeoxygenation reactions. The hydrodeoxygenation of the aldol condensation product over NiO/Al2O3 (493 K, 30 bar and reaction time of 1 hour) yielded liquid hydrocarbons with the selectivity of 77.5%. The results indicate that millet husk could be a good substrate for furfural production, and could be a source of fuels and chemicals for industries. © 2019 WIT Press

AB  - Among many alternative fuels, oxygenated fuels like biodiesel and biomass-based energy (biofuel) such as bioalcohol have greater potential to enhance engine performance and mitigate particulate exhaust emissions in compression-ignition (CI) engines. The main objective of this study is to determine the optimal ternary green diesel (GD) blends formulation by identifying the most feasible diesel/biodiesel/alcohol that meeting the ASTM D975, Standard Specification for petro-diesel. Three steps of product design optimization (PDO) has been performed, (1) specify the fuel target properties based on Euro5; (2) optimize the formulation for ternary GD blends; (3) rank and select the optimal ternary GD blends. The ranking and selecting the optimal ternary GD blends were focused on the correlation of the higher cetane number (CN) over the cost of fuel. The PDO model indicated the most cost-effective and environmentally friendly diesel/biodiesel/alcohol ternary GD blends shall contain 74 % Malaysia petro-diesel, 16 % palm methyl ester (PME) and 1 % of butanol. Notably, the higher CN, the shorter the fuel ignition and the better the combustion efficiency. High CN fuels can significantly burn faster and more completely and hence reduce the harmful exhaust emissions such as SO2. Copyright © 2019, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - The aldol-condensation reaction of biomass-derived furfural and cyclopentanone coupled with hydrogenation/hydrodeoxygenation is a promising route for the production of renewable high-quality diesel or jet fuel. In this paper, we focus on the heterogeneously catalyzed aldol condensation of furfural with cyclopentanone, in order to maximize the yield of 2,5-bis(2-furylmethylidene)cyclopentan-1-one (F 2 C, a C 15 fuel precursor). Experiments were conducted over a series of solid-base catalysts and it was found that potassium fluoride impregnated alumina shown the highest catalytic efficiency. We further investigated the effect of different parameters on the performance of KF/γ-Al 2 O 3 , including KF loading amount, solvent, reaction time and temperature. Over KF/γ-Al 2 O 3 with a 33% KF loading amount, the aldol reaction achieved an F 2 C molar yield up to 95.4% at 333 K within 2 h. Under the nearly optimal condition, the separated solid product is almost F 2 C with a purity of 100%, providing a high-quality biofuel precursor for the next processing step. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The present work particularly aims at assessment of performance in exhaust emissions of linseed oil with diesel fuel in single cylinder engine powered by diesel. Due to higher viscosity levels and slight lower calorific value of the Linseed oil it can be used with or without diesel blends. A biofuel is an alternative to diesel, produced from the living organisms, plant-derived materials. Plant makes sure of atmospheric co2 via photosynthesis by producing polysaccharides, such as cellulose and hemicellulose because they are extracted from the plant polysaccharides, co2 does not exceed with the use of biofuels (combusted), which refers to the concept of carbon neutrality. The results of the experiment showed that the performance of the engine on linseed oil was slightly inferior to that on diesel fuel. The thermal efficiency of the engine was lower and the brake specific energy consumption of the engine was higher when the engine was fuelled with linseed oil compared to diesel fuel. The oxides of nitrogen from during the whole range of experiment were lower than diesel fuel. The carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbon from the fuel was found higher than diesel fuel during the whole experimental range. © IAEME Publication.

AB  - In line with society's growing need for a more sustainable fuel economy, various biofuels and alternative fuel formulations are being proposed. In this work, the ignition quality of a novel tricomponent advanced biofuel is examined. Ethyl levulinate, diethyl ether and ethanol (EL/DEE/EtOH) result from the acid hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass in ethanol. In this paper, derived cetane numbers are established for a wide variety of blend fractions, using Ignition Quality Tester measurements. EL/DEE/EtOH mixtures of ignition quality equivalent to market diesel and gasoline are identified. One mixture of Motor Octane Number (MON) 88.3 and Research Octane Number (RON) 95 is selected for detailed analysis in comparison to a FACE (Fuels for Advanced Combustion Engines) gasoline, as a representative of petroleum-derived gasoline, with a similar MON of 88.8 and RON of 94.4. Ignition delay times for the EL/DEE/EtOH gasoline fuel are measured using a rapid compression machine at equivalence ratios of 0.5 and 1.0, at 20 and 40 bar over a temperature range of 600-900 K. The data shows that at temperatures &gt;800 K, the EL/DEE/EtOH fuel behaves quite similar to the petroleum derived gasoline, FACE-F. However, the tri-component biofuel shows a dramatically truncated extent of ignition reactivity at lower temperatures, with a total absence of low-temperature chemistry or negative temperature coefficient (NTC) region; in this respect this biofuel blend is very different to conventional gasoline. To understand this differing behaviour, a detailed chemical kinetic model is developed. Analysis of this model shows that ignition of the EL/DEE/EtOH blend is inhibited by the dominance of alkyl radical elimination pathways, which leads to a heightened rate of production of HO 2 radicals. At high temperatures, while both fuels maintain a similar ignition delay time, the sensitivity analysis and the radical pool population shows that a different combustion mechanism is occurring for the EL/DEE/EtOH fuel, where ethyl and methyl radicals play a much more prominent role in the ignition process. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Finding renewable energy sources as alternatives to petroleum-based fuels is a current global challenge. One approach to address the energy shortage problem is through biofuels. A promising family of biofuels that has many of the needed fuel characteristics is terpenes. Herein we present a combined theoretical and statistical model for calculating inherent thermodynamic properties of several promising terpenes, which show high compatibility with many criteria of petroleum-based fuels. We use density functional theory and ab initio quantum chemistry methods to compute the enthalpy of combustion, enthalpy of vaporization, enthalpy of formation, cetane number, boiling point and vapor pressure for a range of terpenes with good accuracy. The current in silico study presents a promising strategy for finding suitable petroleum substitutes, while avoiding costly experimental trial and error approaches. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - As a renewable energy source, microalgae have wide interest as a potential tool to produce biofuel and bioproducts. Prevailing in the local habitat, indigenous microalgae are more successful for wastewater treatment processes. Integrated microalgae-based biofuel and bioproduct production with wastewater treatment is a successful practice of modern research. This report describes the isolation and identification of 61 microalgal strains from lakes, springs, ponds, creeks, and rivers of the gigantic area of Malakand, Pakistan. Our study involves the seasonal existence of Chlorophyta in the area, with most dominant flora identified in the summer season followed by spring, autumn, and winter seasons, respectively. The highest ratio of microalgae was found in stagnant waters followed by slow-running water and running water, respectively. However, algal species were reported from all water bodies throughout the year. Commercially important genera like Chlorella, Scenedesmus, and Chlamydomonas were also reported, attracting the research area for further analysis regarding biofuel, bioproduct production, and simultaneous wastewater treatment. © 2019, HARD Publishing Company.

AB  - Plant oils are very important for domestic and industrial use. Biodiesel can be obtained from plant seed oil. Biodiesel is currently popular and in demand due to the high cost of petroleum and to avoid pollution. It is time to increase plant seed oil production and conduct research to find ways of enhancing its production. We studied two species of oil seed plants, i.e. Ricinus communis and Glycine max, with varying amounts of oil content. Proteins from six categories of enzymes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis were selected for study. The 3D structures were predicted using different structure prediction tools. The structures were validated and selected on the basis of quality factors. The pairs of proteins were compared by pairwise sequence alignment using Clustal W and structural superposition by Chimera Matchmaker. The physiochemical properties were studied by PROTPARAM. In R. communis, eighteen structures were selected from I Tasser, thirteen from Swiss Model, and two from Raptorx. In G. max, twenty structures were selected from I Tasser, nine from Swiss Model, and four from Raptorx. The highest percent identity in pairwise sequence alignment was observed between the two species for biotin carboxylase. Biotin carrier was least identical between these two species. Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol desaturase (FAD5) showed the highest percentage of structural identity between the two species while ER phosphatidate phosphate was least identical. Eight proteins in both species had an instability index below 40. Eight proteins in R. communis and five in G. max were acidic in nature. Fourteen proteins in R. communis and seventeen in G. max were hydrophobic. The aliphatic index of all proteins was above 50 with which conferes good thermal stability. © TÜBİTAK.

AB  - For the production of sustainable biofuels from lipid biomass it is essential to develop non-noble metal catalysts with high conversion and selectivity under inert gas atmospheres. Herein, we report a novel cobalt-based catalyst supported on zeolite NaX via ion-exchange synthesis. The resultant bifunctional cobalt-based NaX zeolite catalyst displayed high conversion of stearic acid to liquid fuels. In addition, the effect of reaction temperature and catalyst loading was studied to evaluate the order of reaction and activation energy. Decarboxylation and decarbonylation were the dominant deoxygenation pathways. Stearic acid was successfully deoxygenated in N2 atmospheres using Co/NaX catalysts with a conversion as high as 83.7% and a yield to heptadecane up to ~28%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that higher reaction temperatures resulted in competing pathways of decarboxylation and decarbonylation. Finally, the fresh and recycled catalysts were characterized showing modest recyclability with a ~12.5% loss in catalytic activity. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Field pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.) has the potential to serve as a cover crop and oilseed crop for biofuels. Field research was conducted from 2014 to 2017 in northern Missouri to evaluate the effect of (i) pennycress seeding date on corn (Zea mays L.) yield; (ii) corn herbicide treatments on pennycress yield; and (iii) pennycress on soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] yield. The experiment was arranged as a split-plot design with pennycress seeding date as the main plot and residual corn herbicide was the subplot. Pennycress was broadcast overseeded into corn at V4 to V6 and R5 to R6 growth stages, drill seeded after corn harvest, and compared with a non-seeded control. There were no differences in pennycress test weight, grain moisture, or yield among corn herbicide treatments. Corn yields were high (13.1 to 16.1 Mg ha –1 ), but there was no effect of field pennycress overseeding date on corn yields within years. Field pennycress yields were greatest when seeded into R5 to R6 corn in 2015 (252 kg ha –1 ) and 2016 (229 kg ha –1 ), but no yield differences were observed among seeding dates in 2017. Drill-seeded pennycress increased soybean yield in 2015 compared with the non-seeded control, though overall soybean yields were low (705 to 1320 kg ha –1 ) due to wet conditions. Pennycress did not affect soybean yield in 2016 or 2017 when yields were high (3950 to 4540 kg ha –1 ). Pennycress could be integrated into a corn–soybean rotation with no detrimental effects on either crop in northern Missouri. © 2019 by the American Society of Agronomy.

AB  - Burning of fossil fuels in the transportation sector accounts for 28% of US greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Substitution of cellulosic biofuel in place of conventional gasoline or diesel could reduce GHG emissions from transportation; however, the effectiveness of cellulosic biofuel in reducing emissions depends on emissions during the growth of biofuel crops. The objectives of this study were (i) to measure N 2 O emissions of potential cellulosic biofuel cropping systems, and (ii) to characterize the temporal variations in N 2 O emissions in these cropping systems. Annual N 2 O emissions were measured in corn (Zea mays L.)–soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] and photoperiod-sensitive sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]–soybean rotations as well as in switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and miscanthus (Miscanthus sacchariflorus) from 2011–2013 in Manhattan, KS, using static chambers. No consistent significant differences were found in N 2 O emissions among crop species, though miscanthus tended to have the least emissions. Most N 2 O was emitted during large events of short duration (1–3 d) that occurred after substantial rainfall events with high soil NO 3 − . In 2011 and 2012, most N 2 O was emitted during the growing season. In 2013, 30–50% of the N 2 O emissions were emitted after September which was attributed to freeze–thaw cycles. © 2018 by the American Society of Agronomy 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711 USA.

AB  - Amazon sailfin catfish (Pterygoplichthys pardalis) is considered one of the greatest threats to the biodiversity of continental aquatic systems, causing serious economic and environmental problems in the regions. In this work, the production of biodiesel from Amazon sailfin catfish biomass oil is studied. The physical and chemical properties of biofuel produced were evaluated under the specifications of the European standard EN-14214 by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy, and atomic absorption spectrometry analyses. The results show that the biodiesel complies with all the specifications of the standard, except the content of polyunsaturated methyl esters. The yields obtained from oil and biodiesel were 9.67 and 90.71% (m/m), respectively. The methyl ester concentrations study identified 17 components where 47.003% m/m corresponded to methyl esters with saturated chains, whereas 34.394% m/m was attributed to monosaturated methyl esters and the remaining (18.624% m/m) to polysaturated methyl esters. Finally, mineral analysis by atomic absorption showed the absence of heavy metals Cd, Ni, and Pb, as well as low concentrations of Ni, Fe, Cu, and Zn, demonstrating that the quality of the fuel is not compromised. The study indicates the feasibility of manufacturing biodiesel using Amazon sailfin catfish biomass oil as a low-cost raw material. It represents an environmental option to mitigate a global problem of atmospheric pollution, and at the same time, it shows a commercial alternative to reduce the ecological impact caused by this fish in the diverse ecosystems to which it has spread. In addition, the great adaptability of this fish provides the possibility of a profitable process to have very high rates of reproduction and growth, allowing the generation of large amounts of biomass for the production of biodiesel. © 2019 F.

AB  - The high oxygen content in natural biomass resources, such as vegetable oil or biomass-pyrolysed bio oil, is the main constraint in their implementation as a full-scale biofuel for the automotive industry. In the present study, renewable fuel with petrodiesel-like properties was produced via catalytic deoxygenation of oleic acid in the absence of hydrogen (H 2 ). The deoxygenation pathway of oleic acid to bio-hydrocarbon involves decarboxylation/decarbonylation of the oxygen content from the fatty acid structure in the form of carbon dioxide (CO 2 )/carbon monoxide (CO), with the presence of a goat manure supported Ni-Al hydrotalcite (Gm/Ni-Al) catalyst. Goat manure is an abundant bio-waste, containing a high mineral content, urea as well as cellulosic fiber of plants, which is potentially converted into activated carbon. Synthesis of Gm/Ni-Al was carried out by incorporation of pre-activated goat manure (GmA) during co-precipitation of Ni-Al catalyst with 1 : 3, 1 : 1 and 3 : 1 ratios. The physico-chemical properties of the catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffractometry (XRD), Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) surface area, field emission surface electron microscopy (FESEM) and temperature program desorption ammonia (TPD-NH 3 ) analysers. The catalytic deoxygenation reaction was performed in a batch reactor and the product obtained was characterized by using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GCMS) for compound composition identification as well as gas chromatography-flame ionisation detector (GC-FID) for yield and selectivity determination. The optimization and evaluation were executed using response surface methodology (RSM) in conjunction with central composite design (CCD) with 5-level-3-factors. From the RSM reaction model, it was found that the Gm/Ni-Al 1 : 1 catalysed deoxygenation reaction gives the optimum product yield of 97.9% of hydrocarbon in the range of C 8 -C 20 , with diesel selectivity (C 17 : heptadecane and heptadecene compounds) of 63.7% at the optimal reaction conditions of: (1) reaction temperature: 327.14 °C, (2) reaction time: 1 h, and (3) catalyst amount: 5 wt%. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Marine microalgae are a promising feedstock for biofuel production given their high growth rates and biomass production together with cost reductions due to the use of seawater for culture preparation. However, different microalgae species produce different families of compounds. Some compounds could be used directly as fuels, while others require thermochemical processing to obtain quality biofuels. This work focuses on the characterization of three marine microalgae strains native in Mexico and reported for the first time. Ultrastructure and phylogenetic analysis, suggested that they belong to Nannochloropsis sp. (NSRE-1 and NSRE-2) and Nannochloris sp. (NRRE-1). The composition of their lipid fractions included hydrocarbons, triacylglycerides (TAGs), free fatty acids (FFAs) and terpenes. Based on theoretical estimations from TAG and FFA composition, the potential biodiesels were found to comply with six of the seven estimated properties (ASTM D6751 and EN 14214). On the other hand, hydrocarbons and terpenes synthesized by the strains have outstanding potential as precursors for the production of other renewable fuels, mainly green diesel and bio-jet fuel, which are "drop-in" fuels with quality properties similar to fossil fuels. The validity of this theoretical analysis was demonstrated for the oxygenates of strain NSRE-2, which were experimentally hydrodeoxygenated, obtaining a high-quality renewable diesel as the reaction product. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - This research aims to promote the use of second-generation biofuels based mainly on Castor oil, which is not adequate for food use, and Sunflower oil as a standard reference for recycled oils. They have been applied in the production of Ecodiesel, a biofuel that integrates glycerol as monoglyceride, employing sodium methoxide as homogeneous catalyst and ethanol as solvent, but operating in milder conditions than in the synthesis of conventional biodiesel in order to obtain a kinetic control of the selective transesterification. The behavior of biofuels has been evaluated in a conventional diesel engine, operating as an electricity generator. The contamination degree was also evaluated from the opacity values of the generated smokes. The different biofuels here studied have practically no differences in the behavior with respect to the power generated, although a small increase in the fuel consumption was obtained in some cases. However, with the biofuels employed, a significant reduction, up to 40%, in the emission of pollutants is obtained, mainly with the blend diesel/castor oil/alcohol. Besides, it is found that pure Castor oil can be employed directly as biofuel in triple blends diesel/biofuel/alcohol, exhibiting results that are very close to those obtained using biodiesel or Ecodiesel. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The rapid growth of populations and vehicles has resulted in the rapid increase in the energy demand. Due to the energy demand and fast depleting of fossil fuels, researchers focus more on to find the suitable alternative fuel for diesel. The Azolla Algae oil biodiesel is appropriate to fuel for compression ignition (CI) engine. The biodiesel blends (B20) were prepared with and without Zirconium Oxide nano-additives. The fuel properties are tested as per the ASTM standard and presented in this report. A single cylinder diesel engine capable of developing a power output at 1500 rpm is used for this experiment. The experimental results reveal that the use of biodiesel blend with nano-additives in diesel engine has exhibited the better reduction in exhaust emissions. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Oil is the most important source of energy and has had a critical impact on economic growth for many years. It has become a global commodity and supplies more than 40% of the total energy demand. The research aims to assess the fuel oil supply and demand in Indonesia for gasoline and diesel oil, and projects the import parameter for both petroleum products using system dynamics modeling. There are 3 scenarios assessed by the simulation model: the first scenario is the base scenario in Indonesia, assuming there is no additional oil refinery capacity and supported by biodiesel production; the second scenario assumes the increasing refinery capacity planned by the government; and the third scenario is the ideal scenario that combines the increased national oil production and utilization of biofuel (both bioethanol and biodiesel). The research shows that for the first scenario, import trend projections of gasoline will keep increasing whereas the diesel oil import will decrease and will be stopped in 2024, when B30 is pushed by the government. The second scenario projects the declining number of gasoline import in line with the increased production capacity, but the gasoline import still reaches 11.6–16.1 million kL. Meanwhile, diesel oil demand will be fully covered by national diesel oil production, and biodiesel, in 2018. The last scenario shows that gasoline import declines significantly because bioethanol is produced. However, this would necessitate least 11.21 million kL of new gasoline refinery production to meet the demand and eliminate the need for import. Either way, the bioethanol mandate should be accelerated and increased to E25–E30 in 2018. © 2018, Engineering and Technology Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, we report the catalytic cracking of soybean oil for biofuel over γ-Al2O3/CaO composite catalysts. The influence of catalysts, cracking temperature and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) on the products distribution were investigated. The maximum yield (70.0 wt.%) of biofuel with low acid value (6.7 mg KOH g-1) and oxygen content (5.6%), as well as high calorific value (44.2 MJ kg-1) was achieved over 35 wt.% γ-Al2O3/CaO at 480 °C and 3.72 h-1. The paper focused on the variation of biofuel composition and cracking pathway caused by γ-Al2O3/CaO composite catalysts via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. Calcium oxide would react with fatty acid to yield calcium carboxylates at 300-350 °C, which were subsequently decomposed into hydrocarbons (57.9 wt.%) and ketones (22.6 wt.%) at 415-510 °C. As for 35 wt.% γ-Al2O3/CaO, the addition of γ-Al2O3 was beneficial to generate alkenes (38.2 wt.%), arenes (10.6 wt.%) and alcohols (12.3 wt.%) with ketones decreasing (16.5 wt.%) via γ-hydrogen transfer reaction and disproportination. © 2019 Sociedade Brasileira de Química.

AB  - In situ cryocrystallisation in combination with a zone-melting technique enabled the crystal structure determination of a homologous series of low-melting n-alkyl methyl esters C n-1 H 2n+1 CO 2 CH 3 , from methyl pentanoate (n = 5) to methyl tridecanoate (n = 13), by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Two isostructural groups were identified: the odd-numbered triclinic members (C 9,11,13 ) and the even-numbered orthorhombic members (C 8 , 10,12 ). All observed structural trends, similarities and differences in intermolecular contacts, including the odd-even effect observable in melting point behaviour and unit cell parameters, were easily visualised and described by 2D fingerprint plots generated from the calculated Hirshfeld surfaces, in combination with atom-atom Coulomb-London-Pauli (AA-CLP) lattice energy calculations. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - New models for renewable energy production are needed to simultaneously decrease greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, use land more efficiently and replace large amounts of fossil fuel. Ethanol production and livestock feed integration as practiced in the United States (USA) is one model for ethanol production combined with animal feed production. Brazil, the second largest ethanol and beef cattle producer in the world, can adapt the USA model of corn ethanol and cattle integration considering its local characteristics. This paper evaluates the techno-economic and environmental feasibility of sugarcane ethanol and cattle integration, thereby avoiding pasture displacement into forests or other sensitive lands. Cattle can be fattened in feedlots using some sugarcane ethanol byproducts. Intensification of cattle production by integration with sugarcane production releases pasture area to produce more biofuels, without needing more land for cattle production. The release of pasture land to produce more sugarcane results in what we call “avoided ILUC” the resultant reduced GHG emissions compared to conventional sugarcane ethanol, because no additional land is needed to accommodate an additional sugarcane ethanol production. Simulations were performed using the Virtual Sugarcane Biorefinery (VSB) model developed by the Brazilian Bioethanol Science and Technology Laboratory (CTBE). We calculated as economic parameters the internal rate of return (IRR), net present value (NPV) and payback time. Climate impacts were assessed via Life Cycle Assessment. Sugarcane and cattle integration decreases overall climate impacts compared to non-integrated systems. Techno-economic feasibility is achieved by additional land rental revenues for released pasture area and by carbon credits. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Screening of native microalgal species for different biotechnological applications is a key step to achieve a strong algal database with successful commercial applications. In the present study, a new strain namely Nannochloropsis oceanica NIOF15/001 was isolated and identified phylogenetically using rbcL and the newly designed Cyt-c as an alternative molecular marker. The late exponential phase of the isolate was recorded at the 10th day of growth in f/2 medium, with a maximum cellular dry weight (CDW) of 0.722 g L−1 and relatively high lipid content of 37.7% of CDW. The isolate showed biomass and lipid productivities of 75.6 and 28.6 mg L−1 day−1, respectively. The recorded biomass productivity in the current study was 1.4, 3.0, 3.6 and 2.0 times higher than that recorded in the previous studies for N. oceanica IMET, N. oceanica CASACC201, N. oceanica DUT01 and N. oceanica CCNM 1081, respectively. In general, values of cetane number (52.3), iodine value (94.7 g I2/100 g oil), cold filter plugging point (4.7 °C) and kinematic viscosity (3.97 mm2 s−1) of the produced fatty acid methyl esters complied with those recommended by international standards. Furthermore, application of 0.1 g L−1 of lipid-free dry biomass enhanced Artemia survival by 500% and growth by 40%. The present study suggested the new isolate N. oceanica NIOF15/001 as a promising marine microalga for dual use in aquaculture and biodiesel production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - There are many challenges and technical barriers to implementation of a viable commercial process to produce algae-based biofuels. Biofuels made from algae must typically go through a complicated series of unit processes for algae cultivation, harvesting, dewatering, oil extraction, conversion, and other logistical steps. The National Alliance for Advanced Biofuels and Bioproducts (NAABB) was developed to produce new technologies to be implemented by the algal biofuel industry in an effort to improve the process economics and environmental benefits associated with algae fuels. This LCA study investigated the environmental impacts associated with four harvesting and two extraction technologies developed by NAABB researchers. Gate-to-gate LCA results show that all novel technologies appear to have the potential to provide at least modest decreases in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to current default algae process technologies. 14 scenarios of different combinations of harvesting and extraction unit operations were further evaluated in the context of the full life cycle for producing algae-based renewable diesel. Results indicate that selection of a particular technology for a unit operation can have consequences that affect other stages of the full biofuels life cycle, both upstream and downstream from the unit operation in question. Considering material and energy inputs, operation efficiency, impacts on on-site recycled energy, and co-products credits, acoustic harvesting followed by acoustic oil extraction give the best performance on the overall lifecycle, which reduce the GHG emissions by roughly 45% compared to the base case. LCA modeling also demonstrates that co-products produced at various points of the value chain, for use within or outside the algae biofuels system boundary, considerably affect the LCA results beyond harvesting and extraction unit processes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The use of biomass solid fuels (BSFs) for cooking, contribute significantly to the household air pollution (HAP) in developing countries. Emissions resulting from a variety of BSFs (cow dung cakes, wood, and agriculture residues) contain a significant amount of air pollutants, which are now recognized for their role in climatic change and adverse human health impacts. In the current study, daily variations in black carbon (BC) or Short-Lived Climate Forcer concentrations were studied from rural household kitchens using portable aethalometer. The hourly average concentration of BC ranges from 5.4 μg·m−3 to 34.9 μg·m−3 for various types of household kitchens. The peak levels of BC were found to be significantly higher, when compared to World Health Organization PM2.5 limits for ambient air and hence pose a threat to the health of the vulnerable population, i.e., women, children, older adults and those who have health problems. The study also highlights the variation of BC concentration in different kitchen type. The average BC concentration in indoor, outdoor and semi-open kitchen was observed to be 14.54, 14.28 and 24.69 μg·m−3, respectively. The excess lifetime carcinogenic risk for cooking 4 h/day in these kitchens in the North Indian villages was estimated to be 1.25 × 10−7, 1.22 × 10−7, and 2.12 × 10−7 respectively. Age-specific excess cancer deaths due to BC exposure were measured highest in children below four years of age in Chandigarh, India. Hence, there is a need to shift the BSF users to clean fuel alternatives to reduce the exposure to HAP. This can be achieved by generating local/regional evidences of BSFs associated health risks to support policy interventions. Further, more research is required to improve the air quality in indoor micro-environments and specifically in kitchens. Novelty: The first study reporting the near real-time measurements of BC from different types of rural households kitchens of north India. Diurnal pattern of BC concentration was also studied including the effect of chimney, ventilation and kitchen size on observed BC concentration. This study also estimates lifetime excess cancer risk due to BC exposure in rural households in India. The recent ‘Global Burden of Disease’ report identifies household air pollutants as a major cause of disease and disability in Asia. The study will help to plan suitable policies and intervention to reduce household air pollution in the region. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The Paris Agreement brings countries together in a combined effort to combat climate change and its effects. A key target is the reduction of energy related greenhouse gas emissions. Providing biogas from biomass is one option to provide renewable and less carbon intensive fuels. When upgraded to biomethane it may be a substitute for natural gas and thus may have many application pathways. Recognising this potential many European countries installed governmental support programmes to stimulate market growth over the last decade. However, most of the installed schemes in Europe are time-limited. Besides being time-limited most of the schemes include a degression of compensation over time, resulting in many having limited success over longer time frames. This study questions the feasibility of near-term business cases for biomethane plants and analyses options for making them less dependent on governmental support programmes. Currently a market potential is seen in the utilization of process carbon dioxide in carbon capture and utilization or carbon capture and storage pathways, because it is a widely available side product from biogas upgrading. Therefore, we examined three business cases for its utilization in across sectors. To answer the research question we use a previously developed biomethane market simulation model and added an extension for new business cases. Results indicate that there are specific business options in the field of 2160 m³ h−1 to 20,840 m³ h−1 that are economical feasible under certain circumstances. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study assessed the potential of green alga Chlorella sp. for maximal biomass and lipid production in biodiesel aspect. Initially, growth of the tested strain was analyzed in terms of dry cell weight, optical density and then, lipid content, lipid yield and fatty acid composition were studied. The growth profile study was carried out from 0th day to 20th day of cultivation to find an optimal day for harvesting the biomass. The potential microalga Chlorella sp. was found to yield maximum biomass at about 1.1 g/L and cell density of 2.0 optical density on 16th day of growth. Further, in this study, bioprospecting of Chlorella sp. showed a lipid content of 11.5% on 16th day in standard medium without carbon dioxide purging and mechanical stirring. Adding to that, cells harvested from log and stationary growth showed same lipid content of 11.5%, whereas culture harvested from lag phase was found to reveal a marginally less lipid content of 10.5%. Further, the lipid yield was estimated from the test strain Chlorella sp. grown under log and stationary phases. Based on the data, it is observed that the total lipid of the strain grown under both the phases was found to yield similar lipid of 0.11 g/L, which substantiates the lipid content of the strain. Fatty acid profile analysis of the tested strain indicates the presence of major fatty acids such as palmitic, palmitoleic, oleic, and linolenic acid. With this in view, the Chlorella sp. was foreseen to be a potential feedstock for biodiesel production considering cell density, dry cell weight, lipid content, lipid yield and fatty acid composition at ambient condition. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Algae is a promising feedstock for biofuels. Because scaling up the production of algae-based biofuels consumes a significant amount of water, it is important to consider the impact it has on water stress. This study evaluates the potential for algae-derived biofuel production in the United States (US) and considers regional water stress. We used the Biomass Assessment Tool (BAT) to identify potential sites in the US that meet land, biomass productivity, and CO2 co-locating criteria. We quantify the water stress impacts of algal biofuel production in terms of water scarcity footprint using water consumption from BAT, and the water stress indicator from Available Water Remaining for the US (AWARE-US) system. We assess long-term (20 billion gal per year [BGY]) and near-term (5 BGY by 2030) renewable diesel (RD) production targets. To select suitable algae sites, we consider biomass yield and water use with and without water stress constraints. We found that ranking sites based on biomass yield results in a high water stress impact (24.5 × 103 US equivalent BGY [BGYe]) for the long-term RD target. If we instead rank sites on water use efficiency, water consumption decreases on average by 62%, with an average reduction in biomass yield of 25%. To reconcile tradeoffs between biomass yield and water stress impacts, water stress indicator (AWARE-US) that represents relative water availability by region can be applied while considering biomass yield. This strategy removes sites located in water-stressed areas and keeps high-productivity sites. For the long-term RD target, this reduces water stress impacts by 55% (13.8 BGYe) without lowering yield or 97% (24.2 BGYe) with moderately lower (4%) yield, compared to the sites ranked by biomass yield alone. The results demonstrate that incorporating water stress into energy-scale algae biofuel production planning is key to achieving synergies between biofuel yield and fresh water stress impacts. © 2018

AB  - Solid waste disposal imposes worldwide environmental and economic hardships. To alleviate such issues, the present work uses coal fly ash to in situ catalyze the pyrolysis of wheat straw, an abundant agricultural biomass, and to simultaneously produce heterogeneous sorbents for water treatment. Coal fly ash mixed in varying proportions with wheat straw shows a catalytic effect by lowering the temperature at which many noncondensable gaseous species are released. As the weight fraction of fly ash in the wheat straw increased from 1 to 10 wt%, the overall conversion of biomass increased. 1–5 wt% fly ash favored conversion to the gas phase (especially CO 2 , CH 4 and C 2 H 4 ), whereas the 10 wt% mixture produced more condensable species with fewer detectable oxygenated components and increased furan concentration. For a more complete waste-to-byproduct transformation, the resulting heterogeneous wheat straw-fly ash biochars were used to removed methylene blue, a model organic pollutant, from water, at higher capacities and faster rates than biochar alone. Overall, the coal fly ash may be a potential inexpensive catalyst for in situ upgrading biomass pyrolysis, simultaneously producing heterogeneous sorbents with enhanced adsorption capacities for organic pollutants. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present work encompasses combustion, performance, and emission parameters of experimental investigations of a single cylinder, four stroke, water cooled, direct injection (DI), naturally aspirated compression ignition (CI) engine with a rated power output of 3.7 kW at constant engine speed (1500 rpm) using diesel and different blends of microalgae spirulina. The microalgae spirulina blend of ratio with diesel (BYY) where YY indicates blending percentage (0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% volume basis with diesel respectively) with different engine loading condition (25%, 50%, 75% and 100%) were compared with diesel at CR17.5:1. The output illustrates that the most optimum value is B20% when compared with diesel. The result depicts firstly that there is a reduction in brake thermal efficiency by 0.98%, exhaust gas temperature by 1.7%, hydrocarbon (HC) by 16.3%, carbon monoxide (CO) by 3.6%, NOX emission by of 6.8%, and smoke emission by 12.35% respectively. Secondly, there is an increase in specific fuel consumption by up to 5.2% and CO2 emission by 2.8% for spirulina blend ratio (B20%) as compared to diesel (B0%) at full load condition engine with constant engine speed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Some of the main problems during vegetable oil hydrotreating are the high heat of reaction released, the huge quantity of expensive hydrogen required, and the high corrosion rates in the equipment. Some insights into the advantages and disadvantages of processing raw vegetable oils or their respective fatty acid methyl esters are given. The ASPEN Plus process simulator was used for the simulation of a hydrotreating process, with two different feedstocks coming from the same plant: raw castor oil and castor oil methyl esters. That process was modeled with two stoichiometric reactors in series. The technical viability of using methyl esters as hydrotreating feedstock for the production of biofuels such as green gasoline and diesel is demonstrated. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

AB  - To achieve wider reactivity control, single-fuel reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) through low temperature reforming (LTR) was proposed and experimentally explored. An LTR system was established on an optical compression ignition engine to investigate the impact of LTR on engine performance, where LTR products of the same fuel (n-heptane) as in-cylinder direct injection was routed into the intake port. The quantitative online gas chromatograph (GC) measurements indicate that LTR of n-heptane can produce numerous species with different chemical structures. The higher reforming temperature can lead to the higher fuel conversion rate. Optical engine experiments show that the ignition timing is retarded significantly via LTR. A two-stage low temperature heat release (LTHR) arises at the reforming temperature of 423 K (LTR-423 without LTR). CH2O-PLIF images suggest that the HCCI combustion of unreformed n-heptane cause the first LTHR because of its earlier occurrence time than in-cylinder direct injection and the homogeneous distribution of CH2O fluorescence. Meanwhile, the chemical calculation of CH2O formation manifests that the contributions of each reaction pathway to CH2O formation are different in each stage of LTHR. At the reforming temperature of 523 K (LTR-523 with LTR), prior to LTHR, weak PLIF signals were also captured, emitted by aldehydes and ketones LTR produced in the reformer. In the subsequent LTHR stage, formaldehyde develops at a relatively low speed due to LTR. In the HTHR stage, high-speed images show that LTR leads to a smooth combustion and reduces soot formation. The effect of LTR products on mixture reactivity was analyzed by the constant volume ignition delay model. The calculation results manifest that the reactivity of each LTR product is different, influenced by both thermal dilution effect and chemical effect. The combined impact of LTR products on mixture reactivity depends on both the chemical structure and the concentration in the mixture. The thermal dilution effect of LTR products contributes more for the final decline of mixture reactivity LTR caused. Finally, although the reactivity just decreased under current LTR conditions, it is believed that LTR has the potential to achieve further reactivity control of RCCI combustion to accommodate changes in the operating conditions of engines by changing LTR conditions (temperature, equivalence ratio, residence time, fuel type, feeding water, etc.). © 2018 The Combustion Institute

AB  - The enzymatic route is a promising strategy to synthesize biodiesel essentially because of its moderate reaction conditions and easy product separation. Additionally, coupling the biodegradation of agro-industrial raw materials and waste products with the enzyme production has also had a significant impact on the development of industrial biotechnology. This is mainly due to the low-cost and the prevention of pollution they represent. In this work, different kinds of residues and wastes were used for tuning biomass-bound lipolytic biocatalysts from Aspergillus niger MYA 135 by submerged fermentation using the Plackett-Burman design. As a result, by a specific combination of medium components, two distinctive biocatalysts were obtained. Thus, the production of a mycelium-bound esterase was maximized in the presence of (in g l−1): CaCl2 0.5, FeCl3 1.0, corn meal 2.0, cerelose 10.0, peptone 10.0, and waste cooking oil 10.0. While, the production of a mycelium-bound lipase was selectively increased in the presence of (in g l−1): molasses 5.0, vinasse 5.0, CaCl2 0.5, FeCl3 1.0, milk serum 10.0, cerelose 5.0, peptone 5.0 and waste cooking oil 10.0. Besides, the biomass-bound lipase activity produced in the optimized culture medium was also prepared either free or immobilized in alginate beads, and then individually placed in small-scaled packed-bed reactors to produce biodiesel compounds in a solvent-free system using soybean oil and butanol as substrates. After a three-stepwise addition of butanol, a biodiesel conversion of 57.32 and 95.89% was reached in the presence of free and immobilized biomass, respectively. Biocatalysts morphologies were also analyzed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Electric fuels (e-fuels) enable CO2-neutral mobility and are therefore an alternative to battery-powered electric vehicles. This paper compares the cost-effectiveness of Fischer-Tropsch diesel, methanol and Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers. The production costs of those fuels are to a large part driven by the energy-intensive electrolytic hydrogen production. In this paper, we apply a multi-level electricity market model to calculate future hourly electricity prices for various electricity market designs in Germany for the year 2035. We then assess the economic efficiency of the different fuels under various future market conditions. In particular, we use the electricity price vectors derived from an electricity market model calibrated for 2035 as an input for a mathematical model of the entire process chain from hydrogen production and chemical bonding to the energetic utilization of the fuels in a vehicle. Within this model, we perform a sensitivity analysis, which quantifies the impact of various parameters on the fuel production cost. Most importantly, we consider prices resulting from own model calculations for different energy market designs, the investment cost for the electrolysis systems and the carbon dioxide purchase price. The results suggest that the use of hydrogen, which is temporarily bound to Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers, is a favorable alternative to the more widely discussed synthetic diesel and methanol. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Surge in petroleum prices, its drying sources and degradation in air quality focused interest on renewable energy sources as substitute for existing fuels for internal combustion engines. This study highlights the combustion, performance, and emission characteristics of diesel engines fueled with compressed natural gas (CNG) as primary fuel and castor (Ricinus communis) oil methyl ester (COME) as pilot fuel. COME was produced from non-edible grade Ricinus communis oil. The biodiesel fuel properties and characterization was done as per ASTM D6751 specifications. The CNG was inducted through inlet manifold fumigation at a consistent flow rate of 15 l/min under dual-fuel mode. It is evident from the test results that B20-CNG yields brake thermal efficiency of 23.6% when compared to 25 and 27% for D-CNG and diesel fuel, respectively. The peak cylinder gas pressure was lower in dual-fuel mode when compared to conventional diesel. The emission results show increase in NO x emission by 24.5 and 28.4% for D-CNG and B20-CNG, respectively when compared to baseline diesel fuel at full engine load. There was increase in HC emission by 6.7 and 11% whereas CO emissions decreased by 31.6 and 37.4% for B20-CNG and D-CNG, respectively at similar operating conditions. Reduction in smoke opacity by 49.4 and 59.6% was achieved respectively for D-CNG and B20-CNG under dual-fuel mode. On the whole, COME exhibits a better pilot fuel choice for dual-fuel combustion mode in comparison to conventional fossil petroleum diesel in terms of combustion, performance, and emissions characteristics. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Forest-based biofuels are strategically important in forest-rich countries like Sweden but the technical performance of several promising production pathways is poorly documented. This study examines product yields and energy efficiencies in six commercially relevant forest-based “drop-in” and “high blend” biofuel production pathways by developing detailed spreadsheet energy balance models. The models are in turn based on pilot-scale performance data from the literature, supplemented with input from technology developers and experts. In most pathways, biofuel production is integrated with a market pulp mill and/or a crude oil refinery. Initial conversion is by pyrolysis, gasification or lignin depolymerization and intermediate products are upgraded by hydrotreatment or catalytic synthesis. While lignin oil (LO) hydrodeoxygenation had the highest expanded system efficiency, considerable uncertainty surrounds product yields owing to absence of suitable experimental data on LO upgrading. Co-feeding vacuum gas oil and fast pyrolysis oil in a fluidized catalytic cracker has a complex and uncertain effect on fossil yields, which requires further investigation. Co-locating bio-oil hydrotreatment at the refinery improves heat utilization, leading to higher system efficiencies. Explicit consideration of mill type and energy requirements is required to avoid performance misestimation as an assumption of energy surplus can confer a definite advantage. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The rise of fuel prices due to the depletion of fossil fuel energy and unlimited carbon dioxide let-off are creating a renewed interest in techniques to increase the thermal efficiency of marine diesel engines. One promising mechanism to achieve improvement in system thermal efficiency is the conversion of engine waste heat to a more useful form of energy, either mechanical energy or electrical energy. Thus, this study investigates the potential of exhaust waste heat recovery from marine diesel engines using bioethanol production from selected microalgae as the working fluid via organic Rankine cycle (ORC). It also examines the system thermal efficiency and determines the pinch temperature of the plant. The microalgae Dunaliella tertiolecta, Chlamydomonas fasciata Ettl 437 and Synechococcus PCC 7002 are chosen as bioethanol producers based on the high yield of production. The maximum net power output and high system thermal efficiency are chosen as the evaluation criteria to select the microalgae with the best performance. The results demonstrate that among the three selected microalgae, Synechococcus PCC 7002 shows the highest efficiency of approximately 2.28% for the mass flowrate of exhaust gas of 4189 kgh−1, while the net power output was approximately 5.10 kW. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - With the increase in vehicle density, the amount of pollution along with the dependence on the diesel fuel also increases, which might be on the verge of depletion. The increase in fuel price is an important economical factor. Hence, finding a suitable substitute energy source which is economic and also meets the energy necessity is of great need. During this study, the utilization of pine oil biofuel in which rice husk (RH) nanoparticles was added as an additive was proposed. The test was carried out in a single cylinder, diesel engine at 1500 rpm. Fuel is blended at two ratios (B10, B20) and 0.1% of RH nano-additive is added with each blend and their characteristics in terms of performance and emission are analyzed for varied load conditions. At full load condition for B10–0.1% RH, there is a slight reduction of about 3.04% for BTE and 4.1% increase in BSFC than diesel fuel was observed. Likewise, for B20–0.1% RH at full load condition CO and HC decreases about 27.27% and 19.64% respectively, with a rise in CO 2 and a slight increase of NOx level at 15.63%, 8.76% respectively than diesel fuel. This small replacement of diesel fuel by biodiesel helps in reducing the increasing cost and also the complete dependency on the fossil-based fuel. Thus, pine oil with additive can perform well without any engine modifications and helps in reducing the pollutions. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This paper describes the application of Fuzzy Logic, Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchical Process-Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (FAHP-TOPSIS) for the selection of optimum blend from the various alternative blends of fish oil and diesel. A single cylinder, constant speed and direct injection diesel engine with a rated output of 4.4 kW is used for exploratory analysis at different load conditions. Ten parameterssuch as maximization of brake thermal efficiency, rate of pressure rise and minimization of NOxCO2, CO, HC, smoke, exhaust gas temperature, ignition delay and combustion delay are considered. From the experimental data, multi input multi output (MIMO) fuzzy models are developed using triangular membership functionto predict the engine parameters. The developed model has good correlation with the observed data with noticeably low errors. Then, for each parameter, optimum blend has to be identified for all the loads using genetic algorithm which is a multi-objective optimization process. The engine performance is accurately predicted for the identified best load and blend from the developed fuzzy model. Hence in the proposed model, fuzzy logic is integrated with GAto find the best blend. Finally, from the best blend of each parameter, the exact biodiesel proportion of about 17% for no load, 17% for 25% load, 18% for 50% load, 17% for 75% load and 20% for 100% load are found out usingTOPSIS which will best suit the engine performance and reduction of emissions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) has recently attracted great interest as a thermochemical conversion technique for biofuels production, however, suffers a lack of broadly applicable models for the prediction of product yield. This study developed a unique model for the prediction of HTL products yield via a mixture design of biomass model components coupled with process variables. The model compounds used in this study were soya protein for a protein representative, a mixture of cellulose and xylan for a saccharide representative, alkaline lignin for a lignin representative and soybean oil for a lipid representative. Reaction temperature (270–320 °C), time (5–20 min) and mass ratio of water/feedstocks (6:1–12:1) were chosen as the process variables of interest. The developed predictive models for biocrude yield and solid residue yield showed accuracy of (R2adj 94.6% and 93.2%, respectively), and were further validated using modelled feedstock and actual feedstock. These models can be used either to optimize HTL conditions when feedstock is known, or to optimize the composition of feedstock when reaction conditions are given. It was also observed that within the experimental design range, relatively mild HTL conditions eliminated alkaline lignin-lipid interaction and protein-lipid interaction, and thus enhanced biocrude formation; while more severe HTL conditions were preferred to reduce solid residue formation through promoting protein-saccharide interaction and saccharide-alkaline lignin interaction. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Two perennial tree species Pachira aquatica Aubl (PA) and Magonia pubescens A St-Hil (MP), both being endemic to Brazil, were studied as potential sources for biofuels production. The main benefits of those sources is the lack of competition with the food market and the preservation of native vegetation. The chemical composition and the physical-chemical properties of the oils extracted from both species were evaluated. Furthermore, their oils were processed to produce biofuels using two approaches: obtaining mixtures of methyl fatty acid esters (biodiesel) and mixtures of hydrocarbons (bio-oil). The physical-chemical properties of the biodiesels obtained from PA and MP are compatible with diesel engines. The bio-oils obtained from both sources, despite not being completely deoxygenated, displayed physical-chemical properties acceptable for diesel engines fuel. The possibility of obtaining two kinds of fuels with suitable properties is a good sign for the exploration of those trees. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiesel production using microbial oil is a promising technology. The main aim of this study is to check practical feasibility (in terms of energy balance) of different biodiesel production processes. Mass and energy balance of biodiesel production have been performed for 3 separate processes: (1) microbial lipid production from T. oleaginosus using waste substrates followed by INRS downstream process (2) microbial lipid production from pure substrate using R. toruloides followed by traditional and INRS downstream process and 3) oil extraction from scum and conversion to biodiesel. It was found that employing waste substrates like crude glycerol and municipal sludge in fermentation reduced the energy input by 50%. While employing biodegradable surfactants and petroleum-diesel as solvent (PD) for lipid extraction and recovery significantly reduced the energy input at cell wall disruption step. Biodiesel production from scum is a two-step process which is fast and energetically favorable. © 2018

AB  - The effect of the butanol isomers on carbon particulate matter formation was studied by substituting up to 20% of the total carbon of ethylene, fed to premixed flames with different equivalence ratios, with the four butanol isomers. Soot and condensed-phase nanostructures were tracked by means of particle size distribution (PSD) measurements and laser induced emission spectroscopy, namely fluorescence and incandescence. Butanol isomers, especially t-butanol, significantly reduced the total amount and the size of the soot particles, whereas a negligible effect was detected on condensed-phase nanostructures. PSDs were measured along with the aromaticity and functionalities of the carbon particulate matter thermophoretically sampled in the highest equivalence ratio condition. No significant differences were found among the different butanol isomers neither in the soot aggregate size, as measured by size exclusion chromatography, nor in the aromaticity, as evaluated by Raman and UV–vis spectroscopy, of the particulate matter. Conversely, FTIR analysis showed that carbon particulate matter produced from 1-butanol and t-butanol-doped flames contained larger amounts of oxygen in form of C = O, C–O–C and OH functionalities. However, most of the differences in the oxygen functionalities disappeared after dichloromethane (DCM) treatment, suggesting that these oxygenated moieties belong to the condensed-phase nanostructures, soluble in DCM, rather than to soot particles. © 2018 The Combustion Institute

AB  - This study presents an extensive systems-level multi-pathway sustainability assessment of algae biofuel production that demonstrates the necessity of high-value co-products, examines the impact of public policy scenarios, and identifies improvements and pathway directions required for economic viability. Engineering process models for several fuel and co-product pathways were leveraged to perform high fidelity techno-economic analysis. These pathways included: baseline hydrothermal liquefaction; protein extraction followed by hydrothermal liquefaction; fractionation into high-value chemicals with fermentation followed by hydrothermal liquefaction for fuels; and a small-scale first-of-a-kind plant coupled with a wastewater treatment facility. From these models, it was shown that hydrothermal liquefaction as a fuel-only pathway is not economically viable. Likewise, the benefits of coupling with wastewater water treatment are insignificant compared to the impact of reduced facility size resulting in increased capital costs. These models were also used to examine public policy scenarios, uniquely presenting their impact on the breakeven cost of fuel production and sensitivity to scenario assumptions. Specifically, depreciation type was shown to be irrelevant for writeoffs faster than 10 years. Due to discounting, short-term subsidies were found to capture 50% of the subsidy value in 6 years with an additional 24 years required for full subsidy valuation. Integration of a carbon economy was shown to decrease biofuel production costs, particularly for the protein pathway due to the co-product accounting. Finally, a metric of normalized costs was used to compare algal biorefineries to corn and cellulosic ethanol production, showing that algal systems are uniquely different due to significantly higher capital costs, though operational costs are comparable. This work demonstrates that, to reach economic viability, algal biofuel production must either utilize higher value non-fuel co-products or achieve drastic reductions in capital costs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The effects of light intensity (0–225 µmol m−2 s−1) on oxygen distribution, lipid production and biological community structure of algal-bacterial granules were investigated in six identical photo-sequencing batch reactors (with a dark/light cycle of 12 h/12 h). Typically green algal-bacterial granules could be developed at a light intensity of ≥135 µmol m−2 s−1. The lipid content was significantly increased under higher light intensity, while the percentage of saturated fatty acid methyl esters was remarkably decreased. Results showed that light intensity ≥90 µmol m−2 s−1 yielded enough O2 production from algae, creating aerobic/anoxic zone (0.3–0.6 mg-O2/L) in the core of granules and thus efficient algal-bacterial symbiosis system. Enhanced nitrogen and phosphorus removals were achieved in the reactors with stronger light illumination, probably attributable to the enrichment of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (Comamonadaceae and Nitrosomonadaceae) and algae (Navicula and Stigeoclonium). Illuminance ≥180 µmol m−2 s−1 was found to be unfavorable for Nitrospiraceae. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Promoting biofuel to replace fossil fuels and alternative utilization schemes to replace conventional measures of biomass waste disposal have been considered a priority to mitigate CO2 emissions. Despite fewer land resources and higher reliance on imported energy and raw material resources, the potential for bioenergy supply in a place like Taiwan should be fully investigated. This paper presents a case study regarding the utilization of waste biomass derived from an enhanced production of rice paddy and from the forest sector in Taiwan for biofuel production. In this study, the carbon balance for the two aforementioned bioenergy production scenarios was calculated. The amount of biomass waste expected to be derived from rice husk and rice straw produced from currently planted paddy and from reactivated fallow rice paddy was estimated. Forest sector wastes consist of biomass derived from processing domestically harvested and post-consumer harvested wood products. The projection was made up to 2065. The overall annual bioenergy providing potential of the biomass, estimated by this study, to replace gasoline through bioethanol production and residual combustion and to substitute coal for power generation via combustion were approximately 222.37 PJ and 206.77 PJ, respectively. These values represent 332.56% and 323.24% of the current level of bioenergy supplies, compared to the 76.4 PJ from biomass and waste incineration in 2016. This is the first time the bioenergy potential of post-consumer harvested wood products is being identified. © 2018

AB  - The overwhelming response towards algal biodiesel production has been well-recognized recently as a sustainable alternative to conventional fuels. Most microalgae cannot grow well at acidic pH. The present study, therefore, investigated whether non-acidophilic microalgae Desmodesmus sp. MAS1 and Heterochlorella sp. MAS3 can be acclimated to extreme-acidic pH for sustainable production of biomass and biodiesel. Growth analysis indicated that both the microalgal strains possessed a passive uptake of CO2 at pH 3.0 with biomass production of 0.25 g dry wt. L−1 in Desmodemus sp. and 0.45 g dry wt. L−1 in Heterochlorella sp. Flow-cytometry analysis for reactive oxygen species, membrane permeability and neutral-lipids revealed the capabilities of both strains to adapt to the stress imposed by acidic pH. Lipid production was doubled in both the strains when grown at pH 3.0. In-situ transesterification of biomass resulted in 13–15% FAME yield in the selected microalgae, indicating their great potential in biofuel production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This article addresses the simulation and life cycle assessment of a biogas-to-liquid plant for the coproduction of synthetic fuels (diesel and gasoline) and electricity. The system comprises a biogas dry reforming process to produce syngas, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, and a combined-cycle process. A detailed reaction model of the dry reforming process is implemented in the simulation of the system in Aspen Plus®. Inventory data obtained mainly through process simulation are used to evaluate the environmental performance of the system in terms of global warming, cumulative non-renewable energy demand, ozone layer depletion, acidification, and eutrophication. In particular, the life-cycle environmental profile of synthetic biodiesel as the main product of the biogas-to-liquid plant is calculated and compared with that of conventional diesel. Overall, the performance of the synthetic biodiesel product is not found to be environmentally favourable, which suggests the need for further optimising the biogas-to-liquid system to make it competitive with conventional systems. In this sense, biogas production and direct emissions to the air from the biogas-to-liquid plant arise as the main sources of impact. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Regulated and unregulated emissions from two Euro 6b diesel passenger cars tested using three different blends of hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), fossil diesel and commercial diesel (B7) were investigated at 23 °C and −7 °C using the World harmonized Light-duty vehicle Test Procedure at the Vehicle Emission Laboratory of the European Commission Joint Research Centre Ispra, Italy. The HVO blends used were: Neat HVO (100 vol% HVO), 30 vol% HVO and 7 vol% HVO. One of the vehicles was also tested using the three HVO blends on-road following a RDE compliant route. Overall, the use of different HVO blends and diesel did not lead to fuel related trends on the emissions of the tested vehicles in the laboratory nor on-road. However, HVO-100 resulted in ∼4% lower CO2 emissions than the other fuel tested in all the studied conditions. Low ambient temperature caused an increase of the emissions of studied compounds (with the exception of NH3) with all tested blends. The experimental results showed that in many cases the observed outcomes were probably attributable to a combination of combustion effects, after-treatment effects, and their control strategy. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - In this work, energy analysis is carried out to account for inputs and outputs of energy and GHG emissions associated with the biodiesel production system. Jojoba oil is obtained by cultivation of the jojoba plant, harvesting of seeds followed by extraction of oil, which is then converted to biodiesel by the process of transesterification. Energy efficiency is expressed in terms of the net energy balance (NEB) and the net energy ratio (NER). The use of the byproducts (husk, cake or meal, waste residues and glycerin) are also included as a part of the system boundary. The results show that the NEB and NER values are calculated at 46724.1 MJ/ha (28.9 MJ/L biodiesel produced) and 2.16, respectively. At the same time, the total amount of GHG emissions are estimated at 2.28 kg-CO2eq/L biodiesel produced (66.0 g CO2eq/MJ biodiesel produced). Nevertheless, if manure is used as fertilizer for jojoba plant cultivation, the primary energy input will fall by 9.52% (to 22.49 MJ/L of biodiesel). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Mitigation of carbon footprints in compression ignition (CI) engines can be achieved using biofuels (carbon neutral and carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration effects), with oxygenates and effective post-combustion capture systems. The present study focuses on the net reduction of CO2 emissions through the combination of karanja oil methyl ester (KOME), orange oil (ORG), oxygenates blended fuel and zeolite-based post-combustion capture system (ZPCS) in a single cylinder CI engine. KOME emitted higher CO2 emissions as compared to the diesel. Blending equal volume of ORG with KOME reduced CO2 emissions further by 27% compared to KOME but still higher compared to diesel by 11%, at 100% load condition. Four oxygenates, namely methanol (M), ethanol (E), n-butanol (B) and n-pentanol (P) were blended 20% by volume with the KOME-ORG. KOME-ORG + M20 emitted minimum CO2 compared to other oxygenate blends due to stoichiometric carbon balance, about 38% less compared to KOME nearly reaching diesel emission characteristics at 100% load. Additionally ZCPS was placed in the exhaust line and tested with all oxygenate blends with KOME-ORG, methanol blend led to 65% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to KOME and 53% reduction compared to diesel, at 100% load. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study investigated the pyrolysis of plant acidified oil, aiming to upgrade the quality of oil for fuel use. The decomposition temperature of plant acidified oil was in the range of 300oC-500 °C in 10 K/min according to TG-DTG. The Py-GC-MS results showed that except alkane, alkene and oxygen containing compound, plant sterol derivatives were also detected. The ESI FT–ICR MS results showed the presence of some products produced from hydrogenation and polymerization reaction occurred in pyrolysis process. The yield of the liquid product reached the maximum of 90% at 500 °C. The acid value and viscosity of pyrolysis products were relative high compared with diesel oil. The calorific value has no difference with that of diesel oil. According to above experiments, it was confirmed that pyrolysis components and characteristic of plant acidified oil was different with vegetable oil or fatty acid. Plant acidified oil was potential renewable source to obtain bio-fuel oil using pyrolysis method. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Increasing energy demands and more stringent legislation relating to pollutants such as nitrogen oxide (NO x ) and carbon monoxide (CO) from fossil fuels have accelerated the use of biofuels such as biodiesel. However, current limitations of using biodiesel as an alternative fuel for CI engines include a higher viscosity and higher NO x emissions. This is a major issue that could be improved by blending biodiesel with alcohols. This paper investigates the effect of a butanol-acetone mixture (BA) as an additive blended with biodiesel to improve the latter's properties. Macroscopic spray characteristics (spray penetration, spray cone angle and spray volume) were measured in constant volume vessel (CVV) at two injection pressures. A high-speed camera was used to record spray images. The spray's edge was determined using an automatic threshold calculation algorithm to locate the spray outline (edge) from the binary images. In addition, an engine test was carried out experimentally on a single-cylinder diesel engine. The engine's performance was measured using in-cylinder pressure, brake power (BP) and specific fuel consumption (SFC). Emission characteristics NO x CO and UHC were also measured. Neat biodiesel and three blends of biodiesel with up to 30% added BA were tested. The experimental data were analyzed via ANOVA to evaluate whether variations in parameters due to the different fuels were significant. The results showed that BA can enhance the spray characteristics of biodiesel by increasing both the spray penetration length and the contact surface area, thereby improving air-fuel mixing. The peak in-cylinder pressure for 30% BA was comparable to neat diesel and higher than that of neat biodiesel. Brake power (BP) was slightly improved for 10% BA at an engine speed of 2000 rpm while SFC was not significantly higher for any of the BA-biodiesel blends because of the smaller heating value of BA. Comparing the effect on emissions of adding BA to biodiesel, increasing the amount of BA reduced NO x and CO (7%) and (40%) respectively compared to neat biodiesel, but increased UHC.

AB  - Calophyllum inophyllum biodiesel is seems to be a potential alternative fuel for diesel engine applications due to its non-edible form, easily cultivable nature and abundant availability everywhere in the world. Isobutanol is the next generation biofuel which can be used as partial substitute to petroleum diesel or biodiesel due to its better solvency character. In the present study, a comparative assessment on diesel engine characteristics is carried out using isobutanol as an additive with diesel and biodiesel in the form of binary and ternary blends. Five blends are prepared by 20% of isobutanol with diesel and biodiesel as D80IB20 and B80IB20 along with three ternary blends of diesel-biodiesel-isobutanol using 10%, 15% and 20% concentrations of isobutanol. Experimental study in a diesel engine revealed that the brake thermal efficiency is improved by 3.19% for 10% isobutanol addition in diesel-biodiesel blends with significant improvement in brake specific fuel consumption when compared to biodiesel. All binary and ternary blends of isobutanol reduce CO emission by 13–59% than that of diesel fuel with substantial penalty in HC emission. Meanwhile, when compared to biodiesel, the oxides of nitrogen emission is decreased by 8.16% for isobutanol addition with diesel and biodiesel in terms of binary and ternary blends but higher than that of conventional diesel fuel. Furthermore, momentous improvement is observed in heat release rate during isobutanol addition for B80IB20, D70B10IB20, D70B15IB15 and D70B20IB10 fuel blends when compared to pure biodiesel. Finally, it is noted that isobutanol would be a feasible additive for the partial replacement of diesel and biodiesel in the blends for diesel engine applications. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study demonstrates innovative and industrially viable in-situ biodiesel production process using coordinated ultrasound-microwave reactor. Reactive extraction process has been carried out by mixing grinded castor seeds with methanol in the presence of base catalyst (KOH). Response surface methodology coupled with central composite design has been applied for process optimization to achieve maximum yield. The result shows that maximum biodiesel yield of 93.5 ± 0.76% was obtained under favorable conditions of: molar ratio (350:1), catalyst (w/w) (1.74%), reaction temperature (43 °C) and reaction time (30 min). Regression equation obtained for the model having (R2), and (R2 adj) equal to 0.9737 and 0.9507 respectively shows goodness of fit. First time reaction kinetics as well as oil extraction kinetics studies have been performed on coordinated ultrasound-microwave reactor. Assuming pseudo first order reaction activation energy was found to be 28.27 kJ·mol−1 and activation energy for oil extraction was observed to be 9.11 kJ mol−1. Estimated activation energy for the reaction kinetics and extraction kinetics was reduced by 27%, reaction rate constants were eight to ten times higher and diffusion coefficient was found to be two times higher in case of hybrid system as compared to conventional mechanical stirring technique. Estimated thermo-physical properties of biodiesel were found in agreement with ASTM and DIN standards in comparison to gasoline diesel. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Decomposition of the very weak O-CH 3 bond in anisole (C 6 H 5 OCH 3 ) by unimolecular decomposition yields the resonantly-stabilized phenoxy radical (C 6 H 5 O). This key intermediate species opens reaction routes to five-membered ring species, such as cyclopentadiene (C 5 H 6 ) and cyclopentadienyl radicals (C 5 H 5 ). Anisole is often discussed as model compound for lignin to study the phenolic-carbon structure in this natural polymer. Measured temperature profiles and mole fractions of many combustion intermediates give detailed information on the flame structure. A very comprehensive reaction mechanism from the literature which includes a sub-scheme for anisole combustion is used for species modeling. Species with the highest measured mole fractions (on the order of 10 ?3 -10 ?2 ) are CH 3 , CH 4 , C 2 H 2 , C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 6 , CH 2 O, C 5 H 5 (cyclopentadienyl radical), C 5 H 6 (cyclopentadiene), C 6 H 6 (benzene), C 6 H 5 OH (phenol), and C 6 H 5 CHO (benzaldehyde). Some are formed in the first destruction steps of anisole, e.g., phenol and benzaldehyde, and their formation will be discussed and with regard to the modeling results. There are three major routes for the fuel destruction: (1) formation of benzaldehyde (C 6 H 5 CHO), (2) formation of phenol (C 6 H 5 OH), and (3) unimolecular decomposition of anisole to phenoxy (C 6 H 5 O) and CH 3 radicals. In the experiment, the phenoxy radical could be measured directly. The phenoxy radical decomposes via a bicyclic structure into the soot precursor C 5 H 5 and CO. Formation of larger oxygenated species was observed in both flames. One of them is guaiacol (2-methoxyphenol), which decomposes into fulvenone. The presented speciation data, which contain more than 60 species mole fraction profiles of each flame, give insights into the combustion kinetics of anisole.

AB  - To utilize sustainable biofuel, the current study proposes a novel combustion technique that directly burns liquid ethanol without a spray system. Two swirling air flows are induced by tangentially injected the gas from two concentric tubes at different stages. The liquid ethanol is fed by a liquid tank at the center. At the beginning methane flame assists in preheating the system to vaporize liquid ethanol and ignite the vapor. Thereafter methane is switched off, and liquid ethanol can be continuously vaporized through self-burning released heat. The heat and mass transfer processes are examined to illustrate such self-sustained burning-heating-evaporating system. The ethanol flow rate is gradually increased to provide different heat output. The flame structures, temperature distributions and pollutant emissions are carefully examined. The results show that the ethanol can be steadily burned to provide heat output between 0.7 and 2.5kW. Generally a blue flame is obtained, and the NO x and CO concentrations are ultralow. By increasing ethanol flow rate to exceed 8mL/min, an unsteady, sooting flame is observed owing to incomplete evaporation and poor mixing. A parametric study is conducted to evaluate the influences of liquid tank position, flow rate and tip structure on the combustion characteristics. Additionally, an optimal operation condition is proposed. The current study provides a promising method to burn low-boiling liquid fuel in a clean, efficient and compact way.

AB  - This paper investigates the biodiesel production by subcritical/chemical hydroesterification from crude palm oil. Hydroesterification is the innovation of biodiesel production in two-step: consists of hydrolysis of oil into free fatty acids (FFAs) in subcritical water and subsequent chemical esterification of FFAs into FAMEs (biodiesel). The purpose was to apply the experimental factorial design to evaluate the influence of reaction variables on the effectiveness of hydrolysis and determine the relationship of FFAs and FAMEs yields. Experiments were conducted in a batch reactor under various conditions and the optimal conditions (250 °C, 120 min, 100:1 water:oil molar ratio and 700 rpm) for hydrolysis was determined. The analyses indicated high FFAs yields (86 wt%). Esterification results revealed a conversion of the FFAs in 99.1 wt% of FAMEs in biodiesel production. This study shows that hydroesterification process produces biodiesel with excellent quality as well as traditional alkaline transesterification. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Density Functional Theory and canonical ensemble were used to investigate thermodynamic properties of Syngas and its mixture with natural gas. The following thermodynamic potentials were obtained: internal energy, enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy for temperatures ranging from 0.5 K to 1500 K. It was observed that CO and H2 were the most stable Syngas components, possessing the ability to render Syngas less favorable to the temperature increase. Also, we verified that Syngas presents properties similar to an antiknock agent for natural gas, raising its resistance to temperature increases. Were determined the Poisson coefficients and Bulk modulus for Natural gas/Syngas mixtures and Shomate equation coefficients for some Syngas types, providing a more complete thermodynamic description for these gases. Additionally, thermodynamic potentials of combustion for Natural gas/Syngas mixtures were predicted, showing that this biofuel can reduce the calorific power of natural gas and makes its combustion less favorable due its antiknock behavior. However, a mixture with 30% of Syngas may be useful for natural gas combustion, since it present a calorific power between 73.41% and 79.49% of that of natural gas, which is a substantial fraction of energy released during combustion, showing good future prospects to the Natural gas/Syngas mixture to the renewable energy generation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The trend in utilizing biological industrial wastes to produce biofuels has been increasingly popular over the past decades. The dairy washed milk scum (DWMS) is one of such potential industrial waste, which can be used as feedstock for the production of biodiesel. One of the inherent problems of DWMS biodiesel is its poor low temperature properties. In this investigation, the influence of two solvents namely, Acetone (ACE) and Diethyl ether (DEE) was tested as cold flow improvers (CFI's) on low temperature properties of DWMS biodiesel. It was observed that the addition of 20% (v/v) of ACE and DEE to DWMS biodiesel improved the low temperature properties. The crystallization characteristics of biodiesel and its blends with CFIs were determined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Other fuel properties were within the permissible limits of biodiesel standard (ASTM D6751-15C) with all the blends of ACE and DEE. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Peels from tucumã, a widely consumed fruit in the North of Brazil, were calcined at 800 °C and employed as heterogeneous catalyst in biodiesel synthesis. The catalyst characterization by WDXRF showed it was mostly composed of K, P, Ca, and Mg. The catalytic activity was evaluated by transesterification of soybean oil with methanol. The transesterification conditions were optimized at 1% w/w of the new catalyst, 4 h reaction time, 80 °C, and 15:1 methanol:oil molar ratio, yielding-biodiesel high oil conversion (97.3%). Because of its heterogeneous and non-leachable nature, the catalyst derived from tucumã peels could be reused 5 times under optimized conditions; a 17.3% decrease of catalytic activity was observed in the fourth reuse. Catalytic activity was also observed in reactions at room temperature and pressure, yielding conversions higher than 80% in 6 h of reaction time with 5% w/w of the catalyst. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This research work investigated the optimization of biodiesel production from Sweet Almond (Prunus amygdalus) Seed oil (SASO) using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) models through base (NaOH) transesterification. The Central Composite Design (CCD) optimization conditions were temperature (30 °C to 70 °C), catalyst concentration (0.5%w/w to 2.5% w/w), reaction time (45 min–65 min) and oil/methanol molar ratio (1:3 mol/mol to 1:7 mol/mol). The physico-chemical properties of the seed oil and the methyl ester were carried out using standard methods. The fatty acids were determined using GC-MS and characterized using FT-IR techniques. An optimized biodiesel yield of 94.36% from the RSM and 95.45% from the ANN models respectively were obtained at catalyst concentration of 1.5w/w%, reaction time of 65 min, oil/methanol molar ratio of 1:5 mol/mol and temperature of 50 °C. The quality of the RSM model was analyzed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Model statistics of the ANN showed comfortable values of Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 6.005, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.786 and Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of 1.89306. The RSM and ANN models gave coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9446 and correlation coefficient (R) of 0.96637 respectively. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, the biochar which was obtained from peat was modified and served as the support for the preparation of cost-effective solid base catalysts for the transesterification reaction. The composition, structure and texture of prepared catalysts were examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), N2 adsorption/desorption, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and the Hammett indicator method. It was found that the surface area and pore volume of the peat biochar were increased significantly (from 80.25 m2/g and 105.36 mm3/g to 230.86 m2/g and 296.23 mm3/g, respectively) by chemical activation treatment with KOH. The best performance is observed for the resulting 30Ca/APB-700 catalyst (30% CaO loading and 700 °C calcination temperature), and over biodiesel yield of 93.4% was achieved at catalyst amount of 5 wt.%, methanol/oil molar ratio of 8:1 and reaction time of 150 min. Besides, after reused for 10 cycles, the catalytic efficiency had a slight deactivation in biodiesel production (above 81.6% of yield obtained). The high stability of catalyst was mainly attributed to the formation of Ca–O–Si bond on the catalyst surface. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pyrolysis of biomass converts it to bio-oil, which contains high oxygen content, reactive nature, and poor heating value and hence require upgradation prior to its utilization as fuel. It is desirable to convert the oxygenated compounds of bio-oil into oxygen deficient compounds in the context of converting biomass to biofuel. In this work, we show the generation of hydrocarbon-rich bio-oil from grassy biomass (taking Napier grass as a model compound) using vacuum pyrolysis coupled with online upgradation (or deoxygenation) of volatile products over an iron bed. A comparison between individual pyrolysis products, especially liquid compounds, without and with vapor upgradation treatment, is presented. Online deoxygenation of pyrolysis volatile products over iron bed significantly reduced oxygenated compounds within bio-oil and increased the formation of hydrocarbons. Pyrolysis gases after deoxygenation treatment predominantly contained hydrogen along with C1 – C4 hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide. Amongst liquid products, bio-oil mainly contained C9 – C23 hydrocarbons, phenols, and aldehydes, while, aqueous phase contained dissolved organics as alcohol, acid, aldehyde, phenolic compounds, and sugar chemicals. Additionally, the amorphous and alkaline biochar comprised of nanoparticles, having the porous surface and various functionalities suitable for acidic soil. Moreover, a reaction scheme for Napier grass-derived products is proposed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this research, Oenothera lamarckiana seed oil (OLO) has been investigated as a novel feedstock for biodiesel production in Iran. Ripe shrubs of Oenothera lamarckiana were collected from farms in Kohgiluyeh and Boyerahmad (around city of Yasouj) and seeds were extracted after drying of the stems. Then oil was extracted by a chemical method (Soxhlet extraction system). A maximum oil content of 26% has been found by chemical method extraction. Physical and chemical characteristics of Oenothera lamarckiana oil (OLO) have been investigated. Biodiesel has been prepared using Ultrasonic set-up. By using the response surface methodology (RSM), the biodiesel production process was optimized to obtain the highest yield of biodiesel conversion. In this research, reaction parameters such as molar ratio (methanol to oil), reaction time, amplitude and pulse are studied. Moreover, the performance and the exhaust emissions of a diesel engine have been investigated. All of the experiments are performed at a constant speed of 2100 rpm at loads of 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%. The results of research showed that the conversion of biodiesel was 92.06% under the optimized conditions of 7.73:1 M ratio (methanol to oil), amplitude of 62.59 (%), and 91.22 pulses for a reaction time of 9.65 min. Experimental engine test results indicated that by using the biodiesel-diesel blends, brake power, and concentrations of the CO2 and NOx emissions were increased, while the specific fuel consumption (SFC) and concentration of CO and HC emissions were decreased. Investigation of the properties of fuel, engine performance and emission parameters revealed that biodiesel from Oenothera lamarckiana oil complied with the limits prescribed in the ASTM D6751standards, and this seed oil can be introduced as a new feedstock for biodiesel production in Iran. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biodiesel and blends with petroleum diesel have shown their potential as renewable alternative fuels for engines, with additional benefits of low particulate matter and low sulfate emissions. In this paper we measure the soot volume fraction produced by three different methyl esters processed biodiesels (extracted from palm (PME), soy (SME) and coconut (CME)), and their blends with petroleum diesel, in a series of co-flow stabilized laminar pool flames, using laser induced-incandescence (LII) and laser extinction optical methods. The soot volume fraction measurement results show that all neat biodiesels produce only up to 33% of the total soot volume compared to pure diesel, and that the total soot volume correlates directly with the degree of unsaturation of the biodiesels. Blending leads to approximately linear behaviour of total soot volume, with a shift in slope with smaller sensitivity towards neat diesel.

AB  - The dibutyl ether (DBE) has been recently identified as an alternative biofuel produced from lignocellulosic biomass. In the present study, experimental and chemical kinetics studies were carried out to investigate the effects of dibutyl ether addition to a biodiesel surrogate (methyl decanoate) on soot formation in laminar coflow diffusion flames. The mole fraction of DBE in the fuel stream varies from 0 to 40mol%. Laser-induced incandescence (LII) technique was applied to obtain the 2D soot volume fraction distribution and a combined methyl decanoate-dibutyl ether-PAH kinetic model was constructed to analyze chemical effects of DBE addition on the concentration of key species for soot inception and growth. The experimental results show that DBE addition can indeed reduce the soot yielding and the suppressive effect is nonlinear with the mole fraction of DBE in the fuel mixture. It is found that in the flame centerline, soot reduction with more DBE addition is a combined effect of lower nucleation rate and decreasing PAHs condensation, while soot reduction effect is somewhat moderate in flame wings as the result of the competition between decreasing inception rate and enhanced surface growth caused by higher acetylene concentration. Reaction path analysis suggests that DBE addition can markedly suppress C 3 ?+?C 3 pathways to the first aromatic ring, lead to lower A1 yield and consequently limit the aromatic growth to larger PAHs. DBE is found to be remarkably promising in terms of suppressing soot formation and reducing particle emission.

AB  - The first kinetic study of the oxidation of methyl levulinate is reported. Fuel-lean, stoichiometric and fuel-rich mixtures were oxidized at constant mean residence time (70?ms) and fuel concentration (1000?ppm), and variable temperature (740-1250?K) in a jet-stirred reactor at atmospheric pressure. A detailed kinetic reaction mechanism was proposed based on previous kinetic models for other oxygenated fuels and theoretical calculations. The model was tested successfully against new speciation data consisting of 16 species concentration profiles vs. temperature obtained by gas chromatography (detection by mass spectrometry, flame ionization, thermal conductivity) and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry after sonic probe sampling. Some discrepancies between modeling and experiments were observed for minor species. Reaction pathways and sensitivity analyses were used to interpret the results. This study indicates that for the fuel, under the present conditions, molecular elimination is an important reaction pathway competing with H-atom abstraction by radicals (mainly OH).

AB  - Diethyl ether (DEE) has been recently suggested as a potential biofuel for compression-ignition engines that are known to be significantly controlled by low-temperature (LT) chemistry. However, the LT oxidation of DEE has not fully been understood in term of the formation of LT fuel-specific products. We have thus studied the oxidation of DEE by examining detailed profiles of its oxidation products under LT conditions (400-1100?K). To this end, we have used a dedicated experimental setup including a nearly-atmospheric jet-stirred reactor (JSR) coupled to online gas chromatography (GC). The experiments were complemented by measurements made with a JSR coupled to tunable synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet (SVUV) photoionization (PI) molecular-beam mass spectrometry (MBMS) for a cross-validation of the identification of important LT species.

AB  - Blending petroleum-based fuels with biofuel components is deemed attractive to reduce soot and CO 2 emissions, but fundamental studies of the combustion behavior of such fuel blends suited for model development and validation remain rather scarce. To contribute to the understanding of the combustion chemistry effects of such blending strategies, we have investigated laminar premixed low-pressure flames of three hydrocarbon base fuels, namely 1-butene (1-C 4 H 8 ), isobutene (i-C 4 H 8 ), and ethene (C 2 H 4 ), blended each with two different ester fuels, namely methyl crotonate (C 5 H 8 O 2 , MC) and methyl butanoate (C 5 H 10 O 2 , MB). A series of 13 flames with different argon dilution was investigated to study effects of the specific fuel structure on the combustion chemistry. Full speciation analyses were performed for fuel-rich (?=1.6) conditions by electron ionization molecular-beam mass spectrometry (EI-MBMS). More than 35 species in the range of C 0 -C 7 were identified and quantified in these flames, resulting in ?450mol fraction profiles. The experimental data were compared to simulations by the kinetic model reported by Yang et al. [Proc. Combust. Inst. 2011, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2013] that was chosen because it includes basic mechanisms of all studied fuels. Overall, the agreement of experiment and this model seems satisfactory but calls for further improvements regarding ester as well as hydrocarbon sub-mechanisms. It was noted that the unsaturation degree in the methyl esters affects the formation of hydrocarbons, that depend mainly on the structure of the respective base fuel, and of oxygenated intermediates. The methyl esters have different decomposition pathways leading to some specific oxygenated species. Both methyl esters promote the formation of formaldehyde and methanol, while acetic acid is significantly increased by the presence of MB. The effect of the ester addition is also influenced by the species pool of the respective hydrocarbon base fuel.

AB  - A Jatropha-biofuel chain was organized in the north-west of Cameroon. The aim of the project was to implement an integrated biofuel chain, based on nontoxic Jatropha cultivation, which could provide vegetable oil for energy use instead of fossil fuel and, contemporary supply cake protein for the rural population. The main objective of this study was to quantify the cumulative energy demand (CED) and global warming potential (GHG) in obtaining Jatropha vegetable oil (JVO) as biofuel in comparison with conventional diesel fuel adopting the Life Cycle Analysis method (ISO 14040, ISO 14044). Adopting both Well-to-Wheel or Well-to-Tank value of diesel fossil fuel as reference, a significant reduction in energy required and greenhouse gas emissions would be obtained by JVO utilization with respect to the fossil fuel. The utilization of a nontoxic Jatropha curcas accession is very positive, as it ensures greater protection of human health with respect to the toxic accessions. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 38: 305–314, 2019. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers
